In business_intelligence, data classification has close ties to data
clustering, but where data clustering is descriptive, data_classification is
predictive.[1][2] In essence data classification consists of using variables
with known values to predict the unknown or future values of other variables.
It can be used in e.g. direct_marketing, insurance_fraud detection or medical
diagnosis.[2]
The first step in doing a data classification is to cluster the data_set used
for category training, to create the wanted number of categories. An algorithm,
called the classifier, is then used on the categories, creating a descriptive
model for each. These models can then be used to categorize new items in the
created classification system.[1]
According to Golfarelli and Rizzi, these are the measures of effectiveness of
the classifier:[1]
    * Predictive accuracy: How well does it predict the categories for new
      observations?
    * Speed: What is the computational cost of using the classifier?
    * Robustness: How well do the models created perform if data_quality is
      low?
    * Scalability: Does the classifier function efficiently with large amounts
      of data?
    * Interpretability: Are the results understandable to users?
Typical examples of input for data classification could be variables such as
demographics, lifestyle information, or economical behaviour.
***** [edit] Challenges for data classification *****
There are several challenges in working with data classification. One in
particular is that it is necessary for all using categories on e.g. customers
or clients, to do the modeling in an iterative process. This is to make sure
that change in the characteristics of customer groups does not go unnoticed,
making the existing categories outdated and obsolete, without anyone noticing.
This could be of special importance to insurance or banking companies, where
fraud_detection is extremely relevant. New fraud patterns may come unnoticed,
if the methods to surveil these changes and alert when categories are changing,
disappearing or new ones emerge, are not developed and implemented.
