****** Course Description ******

***** General Information *****
Course Title: CS380L: Advanced Operating Systems
Instructor: bf Professor Harrick Vin
Last Offered: Fall 1994

***** Prerequisite *****
Graduate standing and an undergraduate course in operating systems such as CS
372. Students are expected to be familiar with the material in chapters 1-12 of
&quot;Operating Systems Concepts&quot; by Peterson and Silberschatz.

***** Synopsis *****
CS 380L is a breadth course in advanced operating systems covering both
theoretical and practical issues in operating system design. Topics to be
covered include design and implementation of distributed and real-time
operating systems, system support for mobile/wireless computing environments,
and some case studies. An emphasis will be placed on current design issues and
research topics.

***** Textbook(s) *****
A collection of research articles will be made available by the instructor.

***** Course Requirements *****
Students will be required to read a number of papers in the area and discuss
them. Grades will be determined by two examinations (50%), a term project
(40%), and project presentation (10%).
