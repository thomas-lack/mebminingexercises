****** CS 375: Compilers ******
===============================================================================
CS 375 covers the design and construction of compilers for programming
languages. Each student writes a compiler for most of Pascal; code is generated
for the PowerPC processor and is run on an IBM RS/6000 server that incorporates
the PowerPC chip.
This course has a heavy programming workload, especially in the summer.
Students planning to take the course in summer should expect to dedicate their
lives to this course for five weeks.
