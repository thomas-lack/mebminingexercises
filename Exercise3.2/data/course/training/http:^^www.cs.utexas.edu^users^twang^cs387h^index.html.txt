CONTEST
In this contest, I run all MDBs on my benchmark ( a DML_script and 3 raw data
files: emp.data, student.data, dept.data ). /usr/bin/time was used to measure
the running time. Since the order of tuples and attributes in each tuple may be
different from one output to another, I wrote a Perl_script to transform
different outputs into the same order so that I can compare (/usr/bin/diff)
them. It turns out that 10_programs passed the benchmark without any error.
Other programs failed to pass for some reasons. You can test it by yourself,
here's a sample_output.
