****** Important Announcements ******

I am taking off today (12/11) for home. So I will be unable to maintain this
page for these last couple of days. However, I am putting this link to Dr.
Porter's page and all class related announcement (if any) will be available by
following it. Good Luck for the Finals!

Next week, there will be special classes for reviewing some of the important
topics covered in class. All classes will be held in Painter hall. The exact
location will depend on room availibity. However, notes will be posted on doors
and the office and there will be someone in the office (PAI 3.06) to inform
you. The timing are posted below. Moreover, there will be almost total coverage
for next week by office hrs. of TAs and Dr. Porter, right upto the time of the
final exam. So, if you need any help, feel free to come by and ask one of us;
we will be glad to help. Good Luck for the Finals!

Question #7 on the review sheet (the one on rotating bits) can be disregarded;
it is somewhat beyond the scope of what we covered in class.

The slides presented in lecture on December 5th (summarizing the contents of
the whole semester) are available at the reserve desk at UGL. We hope to post
them on the webpage soon, but we are experiencing some technical difficulties
caused by the length of the file.
