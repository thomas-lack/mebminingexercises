***** Meets Tuesdays at 2:30 in 225 Sieg *****
***** Creating Server-side scripts *****
Please read these guidelines on how to write programs that will be executed
when someone follows a link to them.
***** SEW what? *****
People_to_see,_places_to_go: A collection of the URL's from the 590i mailing
list, generated by Paul's SEW program.
***** What's new: *****
    * Check out the future of the web here.
    * I've begun to update this file. Remember, if you want to add to it, check
      it out first using co -l index.html and check it back in with ci -
      u index.html.
    * This was added with Phoenix. So far, I'm not that impressed.
***** Way Older topics: *****
    * The official release of glimpse has been installed in /uns. Check out the
      manual_pages, as well as the glimpse developer's home_page. If you're
      interested in more details on how glimpse works, you can read the_Winter
      1994_USENIX_paper on the design and implementation of glimpse.
    * Information on the Wide_Area_Information_Server (WAIS).
    * zwhere, a Mosiac interface to the Zephyr Location Database. It shows the
      users currently registered with zephyr, makes a guess as to which room
      they are in, and shows when they registered with the zephyr server. (This
      is just another version of znol/zwatch/zlocate with some extra info and
      links, except that it shows the status of all registered zephyr users and
      not just the ones in a .anyone file.)
    * Notes_on_590I_lectures/discussions
    * Mail that has been sent to the 590i mailing list.
    * Displaying the belief that an index page should be short, Mike relegates
      the reviews_of_web_sites (and comments on what makes a good web page) to
      another page.
    * ... and here are other miscellaneous comments
          o Rather than ramble, Kurt grumbles about some interface_problems_and
            improvements to mosaic that he's too shy to bring up in class.
          o Paul provides a luddite_perspective on the idea for an intelligent
            filter for network information sources.
          o Nick provides some vaguely related comments.
          o The December 1992 CACM was all about information filtering. Check
            out the summary_article.
Remember:If you want to change this document, check it out first using co -
l index.html and check it back in with ci -u index.html.
