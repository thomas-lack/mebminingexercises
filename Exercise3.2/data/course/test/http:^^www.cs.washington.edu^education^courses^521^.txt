      class exam that covers all of the material from the class. The exam will
      consist of short answer and problem solving questions.
***** Bureaucratic stuff *****
Grading Based upon homework, exams, project and class participation.
Working together on homework It is okay to discuss homework problems with your
classmates, but you must write your solutions up independently. (The Gilligan's
Island rule could be invoked: between any discussion of the homework, and
writing up a solution, you must watch at least half an hour of Gilligan's
Island. The theory is that an episode of Gilligan is equivalent to a reboot, so
anything that survives was learned and understood.)
