****** Introduction to Computer Programming ******
***** Computer Sciences 110 *****
**** Fall 1996 ****
This is a one-credit course designed to cover the basic programming structures
needed to prepare the students for CS310 and elementary engineering courses.
The material covered will be sufficient to enable the student to write simple
programs to solve engineering problems in elementary courses.
The material in CS 110 is essentially the same as the first half of CS_302.
