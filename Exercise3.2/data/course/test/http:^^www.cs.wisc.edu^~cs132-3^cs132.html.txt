***** Course Introduction: *****
This class is designed to take you from zero knowledge of computers to being a
crack shot user (and using these skills to get yourself through college and
into the job arena!). Our lab sections are taught using Macintosh computers,
but sections using PCs are available (see CS132_Using_Computers_-_Lectures_1
&amp;2).
The course has two components:
***** Part 1 - Lecture: *****
In the lecture we will discuss computers in &quot;generic&quot; terms, i.e.
general computer science topics. We will discuss how computers work, including
the following topics (not necessarily in this order):
    * application programs (including word processors, spreadsheets, graphics
      and databases)
    * hardware, input/output, storage devices
    * operating systems, programming languages
    * networks and telecommunications
    * artificial intelligence and expert systems
    * computer-related social issues
***** Part 2 - Lab: *****
In the laboratory (discussion) sections you will have hands-on experience on
Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs:
    * word processing (MS Word 5.0)
    * electronic mail, newsgroups, and World Wide Web (Eudora 3.0 and Netscape
      3.0)
    * painting and drawing (Aldus SuperPaint 3.0)
    * spreadsheet and charting (MS Excel 5.0)
    * database (FileMaker)
    * presentation manager (HyperCard 2.1)
    * desktop publishing (Aldus PageMaker 4.0)
An integral part of lab is learning the Macintosh operating system (System
7.5.3) as well.
In addition, there are some special tools (CD-ROM and scanners) available.
There are 10 TAs that teach the lab sections. Both the TAs and I have the goal
of providing you with high quality instruction and a rich educational
experience.
