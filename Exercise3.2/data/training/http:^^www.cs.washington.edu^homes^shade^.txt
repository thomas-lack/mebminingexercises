 Greetings and salutations. I'm a third year grad student here at u-dub cse.
Interactive rendering of complex 3D scenes is currently my thing. If it is your
thing too, then follow the Projects link to the Walkthru project. There, among
lots of pictures and animations, you'll find the SIGGRAPH 96 paper describing
some recent work. ( As a shortcut, you can click on the picture of the island
in the lower left corner of this page.) There is lots of interesting work going
on in many different aspects of computer graphics here. The Graphics_and
Imaging_Laboratory is where most of it gets done.
