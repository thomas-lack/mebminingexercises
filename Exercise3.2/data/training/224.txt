===============================================================================
Cliff got his B.A. in Computer Studies from Northwestern_University in 1990,
but got himself employed as a programmer anyway. He spent two years writing an
email client and a portable visual object library for Odesta_Systems
Corporation. He left there for the Institute_for_the_Learning_Sciences in 1992,
where he wrote educational and traning software in Macintosh Common Lisp, and
then implemented a simulated environment for educating high school students
called the GAMES_Project.
Cliff is now a graduate student in the Computer_Sciences Ph.D. program at UT
Austin. He hangs out in the Robotics_Lab annoying people with his hair-brained
schemes about meaning, non-symbolic representation, and artificial life.
When not programming, Cliff sleeps. In his dreams, he reads and writes fiction;
listens to Ali Farka Toure and Medeski, Martin and Wood; watches MST3K reruns;
plays on his Korg DS-8; and rides his bike all over. Turnons include: breakfast
in bed, new system versions, and raspy-voiced_Starfleet_captains. Turnoffs:
republicans, Microsoft, hangovers.
