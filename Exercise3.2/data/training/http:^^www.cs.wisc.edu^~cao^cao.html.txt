***** Research Summary *****
My research focuses on I/O and storage management in uniprocessor and parallel
systems. In particular, I am investigating two techniques to improve file
system performance: application-specific replacement policies for the file
cache, and aggressive prefetching of file data from the disk. I have developed
a system in which the kernel allocates physical pages to individual
applications, and each application is responsible for deciding how to use its
physical pages for caching and prefetching. The system uses a fair global
allocation policy in the kernel, and carefully integrates cache replacement,
prefetching and disk scheduling. A prototype implementation on uniprocessor
systems has demonstrated that good application-chosen replacement strategies
and prefetching information can significantly improve the I/O performance of
many applications. Currently, I am extending these techniques to parallel
systems. I am developing integrated caching and prefetching algorithms for
parallel disk arrays. In addition, I am investigating the global resource
management problems in operating systems.
