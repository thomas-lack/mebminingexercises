I am a gradual student in UT-Austin's CS program, and I run a weekly happy_hour
for the department.
This is my only claim to fame, my undergraduate thesis. I specified the type
rules and an operational semantics of the OO core of C++. It's available as a
gzipped dvi_file or a gzipped postscript_file. Let me know what you think of
it.
