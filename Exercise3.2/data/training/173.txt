****** QMG: mesh generation and related software ******
The QMG package does finite element mesh generation in two and three
dimensions. The package includes geometric modeling software, the mesh
generator itself, and a finite element solver. It is free software downloadable
from the Web. QMG1.1 runs under Unix and Windows NT.
There are now two releases of QMG:
      QMG1.0,_released_5_May_1995, and
      QMG1.1,_released_20_November_1996.
