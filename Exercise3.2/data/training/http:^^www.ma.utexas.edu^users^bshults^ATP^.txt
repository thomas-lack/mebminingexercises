****** Automated Theorem Proving Group ******
The Automated Theorem Proving group is part of the Computer_Science and
Mathematics departments at The_University_of_Texas_at_Austin.
We produce methods and systems intended to prove theorems in first- and higher-
order logic with the intention of applying these systems and methods to
problems primarily in mathematics, but also in computer science and technology.
