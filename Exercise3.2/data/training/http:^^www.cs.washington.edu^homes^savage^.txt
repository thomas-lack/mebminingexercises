===============================================================================
After sampling the rich post-industrial culture of modern Pittsburgh for six
years, I caught a ride with the 1993 Bershad migration and I'm now a gradual
student of the first rank here at UW. My strong background in 19th and 20th
century American History provides me with a firm, yet irrelevant, platform from
which to "trash talk" my peers:
      "Any fool can see that de Tocqeuville's statement, '[Americans] find it a
      tiresome inconvenience to exercise political rights which distract them
      from industry' is quite similar to current microprocessor architectural
      trends favoring the needs of application code over operating systems"
I work with Brian_Bershad and the rest of the
 merry_band on an operating system project called SPIN.
***** Projects *****
  SPIN
      SPIN is an extensible operating system omnifemtokernel which supports the
      dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and implementations through
      direct application control, while still maintaining system integrity and
      inter-application isolation.
