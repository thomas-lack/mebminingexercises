                            ****** ABSTRACT ******
Joshua Seims is a biologically-based neural network system, currently being
tested at the University of Washington's Department of Computer Science. Having
begun in 1974 as a Lockean blank slate, Josh has learned to emulate observed
behavior and has successfully accomplished several tasks such as graduating
from college, traveling of his own volition, and has recently started to
demonstrate the potential for independent creative thought. The current task we
have presented Josh is to earn a Ph.D. in computer science, and we expect this
to take several more years. This document provides an overview of Josh's
cognitive and ambulatory achievements, organized into Personal and Academic
hierarchies. Additionally, future work is discussed within each of the above
contexts.
