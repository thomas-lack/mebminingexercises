***** Research *****
My current research is in the area of fully automatic (robotic) and human-
centered semi-automatic systems, and covers theoretical, simulation/animation,
and experimental work. In the area of fully automatic systems, our focus is on
development of means for geometric reasoning and control necessary for
automatic planning of motion in a complex environment. A machine equipped with
such means is able to purposely move in a complex scene with multiple, perhaps
moving, obstacles of arbitrary shapes. We are especially interested in a
paradigm which assumes incomplete information and continuous real-time
computation based on sensory feedback (e.g., from vision or range sensors).
This model suggests economic active sensing guided by the motion planning
needs. A strong factor in such systems is the effect of system dynamics and
nonholonomic contstraints on real-time control.
As part of our work on human-centered systems, we study (jointly with cognitive
scientists) human skills in motion planning and space orientation. These
results are then used for comparison with the performance of automatic systems
and for developong hybrid physical (teleoperated) and computer graphics
interaction systems. The major property of such a hybrid system is that it
blends together, in a synergistic manner, human and machine intelligences. Our
hardware/experimental work includes systems with massive real-time sensing and
control (e.g. with thousands of sensors operating in parallel).
