****** Yama's Den : Hell! ******
According to Hindu mythology, Yama is the God of Death. He comes down to earth
to give a ride to those who are on their way to Heaven or Hell. Though he's
kind of impartial, its better not to mess with him.....

***** Projects

 *****
**** CS418 - Ride to Heaven
 ****
This is a train ride simulation for the 418 graphics final project.

The MPEG (3.9M)
The description
**** CS516 - Parallel Ray Tracing in CC++
 ****
Proposal
**** Virtual Reality RailRoad Simulation ****
This is my Masters project. It involves the simulation of a railroad system
including the trains the tracks, the switches, stations, landscape, and user
interaction in a two-wall CAVE environment with Stereo vision. The simulation
is done on a 20 processor SGI Onyx system. The software is written in C++,
using the OpenInventor 3D graphics library from Silicon_Graphics . The
simulation includes on-the-fly landscape generation, dynamics of the train and
the environment and fly throughs.
Document
**** Image Compression Chip ****
Developed an Image Compression chip for the VLSI course. The chip basically
compresses any 8 bit data stream using the LZW compression algorithm. This
algorithm is better suited for images. The chip controls an external cache CAM
(content addressable memory) where it stores patterns from the input stream in
the hope that the patterns might occur again. The chip is capable of
compressing data at the rate of 1 byte in 80 nano seconds. There's no way a
software routine can compress data at that speed.

**** PyraMania 3D ****
This is a 3D game developed for the Software Engineering course. Its written in
C++ and uses Tcl for some of the interface and XLib for the 3D rendering. You
can take a look at a snapshot of the game screen.
