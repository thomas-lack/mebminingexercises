***** Research Interests *****
I've been doing research on operating system support for high_performance
memory_systems with really smart people like Brian_Bershad, Brad_Chen, Alan
Eustace, Anna_Karlin, Dennis_Lee, Wayne_Ohlrich, and Wayne_Wong.
Three recent papers on this subject:
    * Reducing_TLB_and_Memory_Overhead_Using_Online_Superpage_Promotion. Romer,
      Ohlrich, Karlin and Bershad. ISCA '95, pp. 176-187.
    * Dynamic_Page_Mapping_Policies_for_Cache_Conflict_Resolution_on_Standard
      Hardware. Romer, Lee, Bershad, and Chen. OSDI '94, pp. 255-266.
    * Avoiding_Conflict_Misses_Dynamically_in_Large_Direct-Mapped_Caches.
      Bershad, Lee, Romer, and Chen. ASPLOS VI, pp. 158-170.
In addition, some friends and I have been studying the performance of
interpreters. You can learn more from the Project_Rocky home page. We also
wrote a paper together:
    *  The Structure and Performance of Interpreters
. Romer, Lee, Voelker, Wolman, Wong, Baer, Bershad, and Levy. ASPLOS VII, to
appear. Abstract, postscript.
My Bibliography.
