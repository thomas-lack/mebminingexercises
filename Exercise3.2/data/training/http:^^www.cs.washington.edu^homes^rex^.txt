I'm getting_my_PhD here at the Computer_Science_Department of the University_of
Washington, in the wonderful city of Seattle. Is it always raining here? See
for yourself, with this up-to-date weather_report, or sneak a peek at this live
image_from_a_video_camera mounted outside. The camera is pointed at our
beautiful Drumheller_Fountain. On a clear day, you can catch a glimpse of Mt.
Rainier in all its glory (but this is probably not a clear day, so here's_a
nice_color_picture).
