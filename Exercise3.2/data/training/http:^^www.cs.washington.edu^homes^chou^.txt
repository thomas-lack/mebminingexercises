Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I am a grad student in computer_science at the U_of

of school in the Fall quarter, 1996. Ross thinks it's scary.

***** Food *****
I enjoy cooking. Some people say I should open a restaurant. Some of people's
favorite dishes include stir-fried rice noodles and my BBQ beef skewers. My
recipes are now on-line.

Being a computer geek, I have computers and cool_toys.

I am also promoting the use of the Taiwanese language. I am currently
developing computer tools for Taiwanese. Be sure to check out my new
experimental on-line Taiwanese_dictionary. Though not absolutely required,
these pages are best viewed if you install Chinese character fonts.
