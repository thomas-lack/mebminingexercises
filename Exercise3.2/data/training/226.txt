***** Education *****
  Currently I am a Master's student in Department_of_Computer_Sciences, The

***** Experience *****
I ever worked in Chinese_Knowledge_Information_Processing_Group, Institute_of
Information_Science, Academia_Sinica as a research assistant. My major work is
to design a system capable of word segmentation and category tagging using
Hidden Markov Model, and to improve a user-friendly tool allowing user to
execute on-line proof-reading of the result of automatic tagging. The automatic
tagging system now can reach an accuracy of 96%, which can be further improved
because of the continuous expansion of training data.
