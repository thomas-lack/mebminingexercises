Sean Sandys is a third year graduate student at the University_of_Washington.
He graduated in 1994 from Williams_College with a double major in Computer
Science and Astrophysics. Currently, he is trying to finish his qualifying
exams . His interests include Computational_Astronomy, Software_Safety and
Parallel_Programming_Languages.
He recently participated in a panel at the CRA Conference_at_Snowbird entitled
"Retaining and Mentoring Minority Students from Underrepresented Groups". For
those that are interested, here is a description of the Undergraduate_Tutoring
and_Mentoring_Program here at the University of Washington.
Within the department he is co-editor of Mossy_Bits, and one of the senators
for GPSS, the graduate_student senate here at the University of Washington,
although it is common knowledge that he was appointed because of his ability to
bend the wills of men rather than for any literary or political skills.
===============================================================================

When he is not working he can be found listening to Jimmy_Buffett, waxing
philosophical about his glory days on WUFO, or (mis)quoting some of the finest
minds of our time. It is also rumored that he is interested in brewing some
cool refreshing beers.
