[http://
simon.cs.cornell.edu/                            Horus, the son of Isis and of Osiris, was a god
Info/Projects/HORUS/  [http://                   whose attributes appealed strongly to the
images/button-        simon.cs.cornell.edu/Info/ Egyptians from one end of Egypt to the other,
overview.jpg]         Projects/HORUS/images/     because in him every man and woman saw the type
[http://              postcard.jpg]              of what he or she wished to possess, that is to
simon.cs.cornell.edu/                            say, renewed life, and life as opposed to death,
Info/Projects/HORUS/                             and movement as opposed to inactivity. ²

people.jpg]            Horus provides a framework for the development of distributed applications
[http://              based on group communications, a style of computing that can arise in fault-
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ tolerant systems, managed distributed systems, applications that exploit data
Info/Projects/HORUS/  replication or coherent caching, and groupware. Within the overall Horus
images/button-        framework a large collection of system and application protocols have been
papers.jpg]           developed that allow the application designer to construct a communication
[http://              module that exactly meets the application requirements at minimal cost.
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ The Horus project was originally launched as an effort to redesign the Isis
Info/Projects/HORUS/  group communication system, but has evolved into a general purpose
images/button-        communication architecture with advanced support for the development of
software.jpg]         robust distributed systems in settings for which Isis was unsuitable, such as
[http://              applications that have special security or real-time requirements. Besides
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ the practical uses of our software, the project has contributed towards the
Info/Projects/HORUS/  theory of virtually synchrony, a runtime model used for our implementation of
images/button-        data replication and fault-tolerance. At the same time, our software is much
links.jpg]            faster and lighter weight than the Isis system.
                      Horus exists as two systems: an initial version coded in C, which can be used
[http://              for research purposes at no fee but has restricted commerical rights, and a
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ new version called Ensemble, written in ML but usable from many other
Info/Projects/HORUS/  languages, which is available for all classes of users at no fee. Ensemble is
images/ens5.jpg]      actively under development and we will do series of releases over the fall of
[http://              1996 and spring of 1997. By early in 1997, Ensemble will be an outstanding
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ environment for building Java-based groupware applications that do multimedia
Info/Projects/HORUS/  conferencing on the Web.
images/button-ens-    Horus and Ensemble are designed to be platform independent, and are available
intro.jpg]            for different classes of workstations, personal computers, parallel
[http://              processors and on next-generation cluster environments using standard high-
simon.cs.cornell.edu/ speed communications networks.
Info/Projects/HORUS/  The Horus effort collaborates closely with many other distributed systems
images/button-ens-    projects, including Transis, NavTech, and the StormCast and TACOMA projects.
