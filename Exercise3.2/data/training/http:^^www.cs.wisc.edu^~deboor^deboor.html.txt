My_schedule_for_fall_'96. I am teaching CS_412 and MA 313.
Look for some of my former or present students.
Selected recent articles on approximation theory written at UW are available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.wisc.edu/Approx. The read.me file provides access to
individual files there at the click of a button (it's a clickable version of
the read.me file there). The (small) subset of these (co)authored by me are
clickable in here.
Click here for a list_of_errata for the third edition of [Conte and de Boor,
Elementary Numerical Analysis: An Algorithmic Approach], and here for that list
of_errata for the various printings of [Carl de Boor,  A Practical Guide to
Splines]. Check out the latest_versions of the various programs and drivers in
that latter book.
Click Journal_of_Approximation_Theory (published by Academic_Press) for
information about that journal (including recently accepted and published
papers) as well as for email and postal addresses of many approximators and
much, much more. Ditto for Constructive_Approximation (published by Springer-
Verlag). Ditto for East_Journal_on_Approximations. Search their tables of
content, singly or combined, (and thank Paul_Nevai for this handy tool). There
is also Approximation_down_under and Amos_Ron's list of homepages of
approximators.
A spline_bibliography is available.
For links to various publishers, journals, people, resources, see the Ilas
Information_Center_(IIC).
Seek_and_ye_shall_find.
For an organized introduction into the joys of vi, see viva_vi!. There are also
on-screen_tutorials.
Click here for a great picture of Hermite. The same place also contains useful
information about html. But the html-primer might be even better.
For a very unusual and ever_changing home page, try David_Griffeath's
Primordial_Soup_Kitchen.
For various interesting information, see odds_and_ends , and thank Allan_Pinkus
at pinkus@techunix.technion.ac.il or Paul_Nevai if you find any of it useful.
Also, check out Paul Nevai's way to make his_mathematical_output available.
