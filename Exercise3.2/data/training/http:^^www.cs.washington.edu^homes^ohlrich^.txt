  Currently I am working with Nancy_Leveson on model_checking and automatic
  test generation from specifications. In my spare time I have been working
  with Brian_Bershad, Anna_Karlin and Ted_Romer doing memory performance
  analysis on the STD project (locally known as the Severe TLB Damage project).
  Our group's paper will make its debut at ISCA in Italy this summer.
