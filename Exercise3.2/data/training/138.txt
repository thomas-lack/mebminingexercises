Research                                My research interests lie in Computer
                                        Vision and Multimedia. I am currently
                                        interested in constructing a search
                                        engine for images, using some new
                                        methods we have developed.
                                        I've recently been thinking about the
                                        economic impact of freely available
                                        pricing information on the Web. My
                                        essay on this subject appeared in Phil
                                        Agre's electronic newsletter The
                                        Network_Observer in March 1996.
Students                                I work with PhD students Jing_Huang,
                                        Vera_Kettnaker and Olga Veksler. I also
                                        spend a fair amount of time with
                                        various undergraduates, principally
                                        Greg_Pass and Justin_Voskuhl. Other
                                        undergraduates include Scott Cytacki,
                                        Justin_Miller and Rob Szewczyk.

Teaching                                I am currently teaching CS100B, an
                                        introduction to computer programming.
                                        In the Spring I will teach CS664, a
                                        course in computer vision. If you are
                                        interested in that course, there are
                                        scribe notes from my lectures available
                                        on the web page. I have also taught
                                        CS212, an introduction to computation
                                        and programming.
Professional Activities                 I am on the program comittee forCVPR-97
                                        , the IEEE conference on computer
                                        vision and pattern recognition, which
                                        will be held in San Juan, PR in June
                                        1997. I am also on the organizing
                                        committee for the IEEE_Workshop_on
                                        Content-based_access_of_Image_and_Video
                                        Libraries, to be held in conjunction
                                        with CVPR-97.
