[A picture of Burroughs] (This is not me.)
...where-upon he had the effrontery to push my hand severing the patient's
femoral
artery. Blood spurted up and blinded the anesthetist, who ran out through the
halls screaming. Browbeck tried to knee me in the groin, and I managed to
hamstring him with my scalpel. He crawled about the floor stabbing at my feet
and
legs. Voilet, that's my baboon assistant --only woman I ever cared a damn
about--
really wigged. I climbed up on the table and poise myself to jump on Browbeck
with
both feet and stomp him when the cops rushed in.
