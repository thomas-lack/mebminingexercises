" Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum
for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play
at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and
feet that smell?"
-- Richard Lederer [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~weiruc/pictures/justice.gif]
" There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be
offered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a series
of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of food, and the
merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection increases, the
entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the affection IS the
entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no circumstances can the food
be omitted."
