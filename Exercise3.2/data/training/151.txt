My research interests are in the area of information retrieval and text
processing. My thesis advisor was (late) Prof._Gerard_Salton. My current thesis
supervisors are Dr. Chris Buckley and Prof._Claire_Cardie
Here is a postscript copy of my resume.
The Smart_group at Cornell CS department has been one of the foremost research
groups in the field of information retrieval for last thirty years. Our current
research involves:
    * Document Length Normalization in Information Retrieval
      To fairly retrieve texts of varying sizes, document length normalization
      is commonly used in term weighting. We show that effective systems should
      retrieve documents of all sizes with chances similar to their likelihood
      of relevance. We propose pivoting, a new technique that can be used to
      modify existing normalization functions to yield substantial improvements
      in retrieval effectiveness. We also propose a new and effective
      normalization technique.

    * Our TREC Participation
      Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) is a NIST and ARPA co-sponsored effort
      to objectively evaluate various information retrieval techniques on an
      independent testbed. The Smart system has consistently been one of the
      best systems at TREC.

    * Automatic Text Structuring and Summarization
      Non expository texts are not usually read from cover to cover. Readers
      are helped in such circumstances by providing selective access to text
      excerpts as needed. We have developed techniques to analyze the structure
      of a text and provide tools for selective text traversal.
