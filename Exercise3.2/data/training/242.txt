****** Doug Stuart's Home Page ******
****** Welcome! ******
This page is under construction (what page isn't), so bear with me. I am not
sure what I will put here, but for now, there are a number of links to
interesting places, as well as some information about Sports , science_fiction
, books in general, and a few jokes (test of latex2html), or a weather_map and
conditions_at_Austin and New_Orleans . I guess I am sort of using this as my
own personal archive, and am graciously sharing it with the web. I'm not sure
why, but I'm doing it. Perhaps because the linking process provides me with an
index, and putting it all here is just as simple as keeping it to myself, and
the web browser provides a useful database browser as well. I don't know if
this is a good idea or not, but if I'm going to save something, it is just as
easy to save it in a web accessible manner.
