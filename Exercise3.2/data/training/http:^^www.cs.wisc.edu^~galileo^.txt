                       ***** Galileo at Wisconsin *****
                    [Obligatory header picture for Galileo]
Galileo is a project being conducted in the computer_architecture_group at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our project focuses on the medium- to long-
term evolution of processor and system architectures, with an emphasis on the
memory system. Specifically, we are studying what the relationship between the
processor and main memory will be in future systems: completely separate, as
today, or integrated (and if so, to what extent).
Processing capability and bit storage may merge in at least two ways. Because
of increasing off-chip penalties (in issuable instructions) and/or limited off-
chip bandwidth, designers may place more and more capacity on the processor
chip and module, until eventually a sizable fraction of main memory resides on-
chip (represented by the arrow labeled MOP in the above diagram). A different
possibility is the migration of processor capability onto the DRAM chips
themselves, eventually obviating the central processor (see the IRAM arrow
above). Our specific research currently focuses on the following areas:
    * Examining the performance impact of large memory latencies and limited
      memory bandwidth in current and future microprocessor-based systems
    * Performance modeling of the various design points along the processor/
      memory (P/M) integration spectrum
    * Cache hierarchy design for P/M integrated systems
    * Design of main memory banks in a P/M integrated system
    * Program execution in systems with multiple integrated chips (DataScalar
      architectures)

                               SCI at Wisconsin
Our group is also closely involved with research relating to cache-coherent
shared-memory multiprocessor design, specifically studying the Scalable
Coherent Interfacecoherence and transport layers. We are using SCI, which is an
IEEE standard (1596-1992), as a base platform for the exploration of our ideas.
The SCI standard specifies a linked-list based hardware coherence protocol,
which includes support for efficient synchronization primitives (Queue On Lock
Bit, or QOLB), as well as optimizations for different sharing patterns, such as
pairwise-sharing and fresh read-sharing. The standard also includes a
definition for an extremely high-bandwidth (1 GB/s), low latency transport
layer in between processing elements or individual clusters. We are currently
performing SCI-related research on the following topics:
    * Extending SCI with logarithmically-growing sharing structures
    * Efficient hardware synchronization for shared-memory multiprocessors
    * A scalability study of the base SCI protocol, including its standard
      extensions
    * Aggressive consistency models for shared-memory multiprocessors
