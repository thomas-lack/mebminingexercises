**** Work World ****
My research interests include operating systems, distributed and parallel
systems, networking, and security. Currently, with help from my advisor, John
Zahorjan, I'm building system support for running soft real-time applications
(e.g., visualization) on partially idle workstations in NOWs. Recently, I
completed a study on how runtime measurements of application characteristics
can be used by a runtime system to minimize application execution time in
uniprogrammed multiprocessors environments as well as by a system scheduler to
make &quot;good&quot; global scheduling decisions in multiprogrammed
multiprocessors environments.
