Dan_Huttenlocher and I founded the Cornell_Robotics_and_Vision_Laboratory in
1991.
***** Research *****
My interests include robotics, microelectromechanical_systems, geometric
algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Robotics_is_the_science_that_seeks_to
forge_an_intelligent,_computational_connection_between_perception_and_action.
Working with graduate student Jim Jennings, research associate Daniela_Rus,
graduate student Russell_Brown, and lab alumnus Jonathan_Rees (now at MIT), we
developed a team_of_autonomous_mobile_robots that can perform sophisticated
distributed_manipulation_tasks (such as moving_furniture). The robots run
robust SPMD protocols that are completely asynchronous and require no
communication. With grad student Karl_Böhringer and EE Professor Noel
MacDonald, we are building a massively_parallel_array_of_microactuators in the
Cornell National Nanofabrication Laboratory. The_array_is_a_SCREAM_chip
containing_over_11,000_actuators_in_1_square_centemeter, and can orient small
parts without sensory feedback. Our microfabricated actuator arrays could be
used to construct programmable parts-feeders (at any scale), or to build self-
propelled IC's (walking VLSI chips.) Graduate student Amy_Briggs worked with
Dan Huttenlocher's vision group to develop a_sensor_planning_and_surveillance
system_for_a_team_of_mobile_robots. The robots use on-board vision to detect
and intercept targets in the lab.
