Candlelight_Vigil_Across_the_Internet to help increase awareness of violence
against women.
***** Research *****
My current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily in the
area of machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in Natural Language
Acquisition. Learning to produce a deep semantic representation from an input
sentence would be useful in many tasks. My Ph.D. proposal is on corpus-based
lexical acquisition. I wrote my Master's Thesis on a system which learned rules
suitable for use in a diagnostic expert system. I am also interested in mobile
robots, and had an exhibit at Robofest 5 in 1994. In the spring semester of
1995, I was the TA for "Building_Intelligent_Agents". Here's my finger
information, a_picture_of_me, my vita, and a list of my publications. Also, see
the_Machine_Learning_page for more information on our group.
