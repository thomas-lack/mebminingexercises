About Me!!!
This page has been up for a while now, so I've felt inclined to change the
first sentence. My birth name is Jonathan Barber, but people usually just call
me Jon (not J-O-H-N!!). People also call me Ponch or Pooch. People used to call
me Lake, Fork, Guppie, Skin Mama, Phin,and the list goes on and on. I am
finishing up my degree as a graduate student in the Masters of Engineering
Program in Computer_Science at Cornell_University. I was also an undergrad at
Cornell, where I got a BA in Computer Science as well.
I grew up in a couple of towns in New Jersey, and attended Montgomery High
School. I'm currently living in Collegetown which is adjacent to the Cornell
Campus. I'm in a cheap summer sublet on College Ave, which is ultra-convenient,
since I can work and play in the same half-mile radius.
While a student at Cornell, I went Greek, and spent a lot of time at Tau
Epsilon_Phi, a fraternity on the borders of Cayuga Heights. Its kind of hard to
believe that those days are over, but on the other hand, its about time.

What I'm doing Now
I have finished my Masters of Engineering Project with Prof._Thorsten_von
Eicken, where we developed the U-Net_Packet_Filter. The filter works with U-
Net, which is a high-bandwidth network protocol that can bring parallel
computing home to personal computers.
I also taught the 6-week summer session of CS099:_Fundamental_Programming
Concepts, an introductory course to computers and programming. This past year,
I was a teaching assistant for CS314: An Introduction to Digital Systems and
Computer Organization. during Fall-95 and Spring-96.

Course and Research Interests
This past semester, I worked a lot on RivL (A Resolution Independent Video
Language), which is one of the products from the Multimedia Research group at
Cornell. The final product of my labor is two project reports.
    * Two_Parallel_Implementations_of_Continuous_Media_RivL
    * An_Improved-Implementation_of_an_Object_Tracker_in_RivL
I have also taken an interest in high performance compilers. My good friend
Sugata_Mukhopadhyay and I are still finishing up a class project, in which we
implemented a SMPD code generator for High-Performance Fortran based on a
linear algebra framework (paper coming soon).
In the previous semester,my other good friend, Greg Weber and I, developed
WeBar Encryption
, a smart encryption protocol for frame-dependent video streams (e.g. MPEG).
Unfortunately, I don't have the paper in electronic form, so you'll have to
trust me on this.

[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/barber/bullet_white.gif]The Future Looks
Bright, and Wet!

At the end of this summer, I'm packing up my gear, and taking a permanent road-
trip to Oregon (hopefully with some buddies). If any of you web-surfers are
from Oregon, and have some information you'd like to share (good or bad),
please write me.
Once there, I'll be working for Intel_Corp, so go ahead and buy a PC.

A live picture taken from my future home in Portland!
Clarification: Actually its not the location of my *house* (as some people have
thought). I would indeed be pretty resourcefull if I set up a camera against my
living room window, and piped it out to this page. No, by *home*, I mean the
general location of where I'll living, not the house.

My Favorite People (who are on-line)
My comrade-in-Upson, George Bush, has a really nice page, and in it he keeps a
listing of his favorite people. If you can be found on this page, you are
indeed one of the lucky. I was also considering keeping a list of my least-
favorite people (you know who your are), but have decided otherwise.
Ok, here goes:
    * George_Bush
      , or as I like to call him,
      Captain Swirl
      . He's nefarious with a toilet.
    * Sugata_Mukhopadyay
    * Boney_Magoo
    * Fletop
    * Bigro
    * Dave_Koster,
      the bot of all bots.
