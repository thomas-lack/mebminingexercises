[[Exciting Picture of Greg]]
My lovely wife Corina is currently in her third year of the graduate program in
the Political_Science here at U_of_W.
===============================================================================
I'm in my third year in the graduate program at the Computer_Science_Department
at the University_of_Washington, slaving away toward the lofty goal of my Ph.D.
I completed his undergraduate degree at the University_of_California_at_San
Diego with an odd double-major in Computer Science and Political Science.
I'm going on leave from graduate school in mid-December and I'm actively
looking for a position in software development. If you're interested, you can
check out my resume.

*** Java Applets: ***
    * WebView allows you to see the links to and from a page or set of pages.
            [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/glinden/WebViewSmall.gif]

      There are two new additions to the WebView family, AltaVistaWebView and
      MetaWebView. Instead of entering a URL, you enter keywords for AltaVista
      or Metacrawler and WebView hits the search service, returning a graph
      displaying all the pages found by the search services with the links
      between those pages.

    * The Automated_Travel_Assistant emulates the dialog between a travel agent
      and client, gradually eliciting your flight preferences while allowing
      you to browse real flight data. It's a research prototype, but it has
      quite a bit of functionality even at this early stage.
              [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/glinden/ATASmall.gif]
    * ATA and WebView have been highly rated by Gamelan and JARS. ATA was rated
      "Top 1% of Java applets" by JARS, "What's Cool" by Gamelan, and was a
      Gamelan staff pick. WebView was rated "Top 5% of Java applets" by JARS,
      "What's Cool" by Gamelan, and was a Gamelan staff pick.

      And AltaVistaWebView was one of the winners of the Java_Repository Java
      Contest!

      My applets have also been published in two books:
          o A. Walsh, Foundations of Java, IDG Books, 1996
          o Le Meilleur de Java (The Best of Java), 1996
    * Here's my first Java applet, Linear Ballet.
            Oops! You're not using a Java-capable browser. Sorry. No cool
                                Java applets for you.
The_source demonstrates using double-buffering to avoid flicker and using
threads to give time to other running applets. The code certainly could be
cleaner, though, so don't expect a work of art here.
If you thought that was cool, you might have low enough standards to be
impressed by my LGrammer or Particle_Tree applets. Both draw trees. The
LGrammer trees look much more realistic than the ParticleTree trees, but both
are interesting.
===============================================================================
I recently started a position as a JARS_judge, evaluating the Java applets that
are submitted to the JARS archive. Very interesting work.
In the summer of 1995, I developed Dawn of Civilization, a demonstration
application showing that planning techniques can successfully be applied in
entertainment software, for Myriad Software.
At UCSD, I worked with Professor Rik Belew and Filippo Menzer on the Latent
Energy_Environments_(LEE) project, a tool for developing artificial life models
and experimenting with artificial neural network and evolutionary learning in
software enviroments.

Adam_Carlson, Sujay_Parekh, and I wrote a fun ray tracer as one of the projects
in CS557 (graduate computer graphics). Here's some of the images...
    * The_Headless_Horseman
    * Closeup_of_the_Headless_Horseman
    * Chess_Duel
    * Some_Assembly_Required
    * Spheres, an image with reflection, transparency, shadows, distributed ray
      tracing, adaptive sampling, and a mess of other cool things. The patterns
      on the spheres are because they're both transparent and reflective,
      causing the rays to reflect and refract multiple times both from the
      surface and internally.
We also made a 90 second computer animation called "The Strike". The animation
was written using SGI Inventor and C code to manipulate the 3D models. The
original SGI movie file was 70mb. We have made a lower_quality_27.5mb_QuickTime
movie available and a very_low_quality_6.5mb_QuickTime_movie available. Sorry,
it just doesn't compress any further than this (at least with anything
resembling reasonable quality).
