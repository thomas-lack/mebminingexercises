***** Personal *****
Yeah right, like I'd put anything personal here. Okay, maybe a little.
***** Academics *****
Current Research: For the past year I have been working with Brian_Bershad. My
primary responsibility is the construction of a UNIX server for the SPIN
operating system. SPIN is an operating system on which applications can achieve
impressive performance by dynamically extending the kernel. Safety and
protection are maintained at the language level, as SPIN and its extensions are
written in Modula-3.
The user-level SPIN UNIX server is a slight variant of a DEC OSF/1 Unix server,
which thinks it is running on Mach. SPIN dynamically linked extensions are used
to intercept OSF/1 system calls and to emulate a Mach kernel environment.
Previous Research: SPIN is not the first extensible system I have worked on. In
my undergraduate_studies at Notre_Dame I helped implement user-level memory
management for an extensible communications subsystem.
***** Web Stuff *****
I'm afraid I don't have the time to sit around and surf the Web, so I wouldn't
claim to know about all the cool stuff out there. I promise to do more surfing
as soon as I have Netscape-enhanced this page (don't hold your breath).
Meanwhile, these are some of the sites I visit occasionally for work and for
distraction.
    * University_of_Washington_Computer_Science_and_Engineering: the reason I'm
      in Seattle.
    * University_of_Washington: UW homepage, featuring an up-to-date view of
      campus weather conditions.
    * SPIN: what occupies the vast majority of my time.
    * Modula-3: the language I use for most of my programming these days.
    * GDB_Debugging_Manual: how I've solved countless problems.
    * University_of_Notre_Dame: my undergraduate institution.
    * Notre_Dame_Bands: my undergraduate life.
    * Notre_Dame_Trumpet_Section: more of my undergraduate life.
    * CSE_Racquetball_Ladder: my main outlet for athletics.
    * ESPN_Sportzone: how I stay in touch with the sports world.
    * USA_Today: how I stay in touch with the rest of the world.
    * Dilbert: how I learn about the real world.
    * Restaurants: fine Seattle eateries, as recommended by others in computer
      science here at UW.
    * Movies: Seattle regional movie listings.
    * Transportation: an on-line guide to Seattle's excellent public
      transportation system.
    * Current_Traffic_Conditions: current status of Seattle's infamous traffic.
    * Seattle_Mariners: the first Major League Baseball team with a web page.
    * L._L._Bean: the only shopping Web page I will visit.
