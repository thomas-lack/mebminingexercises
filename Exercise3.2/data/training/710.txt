***** Research Interests *****
I am a first year PhD student interested in programming_languages,
architecture, and systems. Specifically I am interested in:
    * Compiler (optimization) technology and how it will be influenced by
      hardware and operating systems advances.
    * Mobile programming (such as Java) and what additional challenges this
      presents to compilers, architecture and operating system designers.
    * Many, many other things, many of which I don't even know that I am
      interested in... yet.

***** Computing Interests *****
    * Java! - Other_java_resources.
    * NeXT_Software - Once NeXT Computer, now a software only company.
    * ACM - ACM (founded 1947) is an international scientific and educational
      organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and
      application of information technology, serving both professional and
      public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by
      promoting the highest professional and ethical standards. (A direct quote
      from their web page)
***** Personal Interests *****
    * NFL_Football - I am a big NFL football fan. Since I lived in Minnesota
      for over 20 years, my favorite team is the Minnesota_Vikings. (Even
      though I now live in the land of cheese heads.)
    * Colonize_and_Conquer is a multi-player play-by-e-mail space exploration
      and combat game which I wrote.
    * Babylon_5 - The best show on TV. (IMHO)
    * Atlantis_3.0 - Atlantis is a play-by-email game set in the mythical world
      of atlantis. Players build armies, engauge in trade, explore lands, fight
      each other and wondering monsters, train wizards, discover the
      underworld. Right now there are 200+ players, of which I am one.
