[Real-Time Systems Group
Department of Computer Sciences
The University of Texas at Austin]
The Real-Time Systems research group is headed by Prof._Aloysius_Mok. In the
past few years, we have worked towards laying the groundwork for establishing a
firm theoretical foundation for real-time systems and also to build design
tools based on this foundation. Our work can be categorized into three areas as
follows:
    * Specification and Modeling: precise formulation of real-time properties
      of systems.
    * Analysis and Verification: reasoning about real-time properties.
    * Synthesis: enforcing stringent timing constraints and other real-time
      properties.
