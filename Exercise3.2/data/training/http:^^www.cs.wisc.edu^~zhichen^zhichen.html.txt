Best Paper Award 9th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing, ACM Press,
July, 1995.
My research interest is in the area of programming_languages and performance
issues in parallel and distributed systems. Recently, I have been studying
techniques to detect and eliminate performance bottlenecks in Distributed
Shared-Memory Systems. I have combined the Paradyn_Performance_Tool with
Blizzard of the Wisconsin_Wind_Tunnel on both the Thinking Machine CM-5 and the
Cluster of Workstations (COW).
