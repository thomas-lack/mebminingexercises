[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/pighin/gaston.gif] Clicking on the above
picture should provide you a sample of my charming French accent. And here
you'll get a more accurate picture of me.
***** Salut, *****
I'm a graduate student from France and I'm trying to survive to the graduate
program in Computer Science and to the Northwest. My hometown is Nimes, which
is well known for its remains of the Roman Empire (spurs of ancient yet
glorious times) and is the driest city in France.
I've spent my undergraduate studies in Paris (Université Paris VI and Institut
National_des_Télécommunications), which is a wonderful city if you are a
tourist.
This quarter I'm TAing CSE_457, taught by Anna Karlin.
I'm one of the guys in c112, where I can be found much too often.
Hi Dani, here is my quals_report.
As for the rest, I like British movies, the Monty_Python, swimming, Nick_Cave,
Corto_Maltese (an Italian comics), cats, Paris, Berlin, Venise, the Simpsons
(2.7 M mpeg) .. and the rain when it's a surprise.
I like traditionnal french_marine_songs and try to collect them.
Otherwise, I'm working in graphics under Anna Karlin's supervision, although I
was formerly studying system here and got my name on a paper:
Implementing_Global_Memory_Management_in_a_Workstation_Cluster. Michael J.
Feeley, William E. Morgan, Frederic H. Pighin, Anna R. Karlin, Henry M. Levy,
and Chandramohan A. Thekkath. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Symposium on
Operating Systems Principles, December 1995. [postscript]

***** New: Live Action !  *****
Here is a breath-taking picture of c112 door (refreshed every two minutes). And
if you are very lucky you might even have a look at Darren_or_Juan, .. note
that it might be dark here.
More live action with a picture of UW's_Red_Square (refreshed every five
minutes), .. note that it might rain there.
