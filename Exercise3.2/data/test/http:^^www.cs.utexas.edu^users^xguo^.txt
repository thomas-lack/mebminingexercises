**** About me ****
I've been hanging around at the_University_of_Texas_at_Austin for a while.
Being a Ph.D student in Department_of_Computer_Science, I work in Distributed
Multimedia_Computing_Lab headed by Dr._Harrick_Vin. This year, the graduate
program of UT-CS is ranked_7th_in_the_nation, what a delightful surprise. No,
not really a surprise, we've been doing pretty well, do we?
[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/xguo/icons/me-emboss.jpg] A picture of me?
Well, it's hard to take a picture of myself. I'm working on it, my picture as
well as more interesting stuff will be on line soon. Right now, as a temporary
resort, you can imagine of me as ... , Hopefully, as time goes by, I'll
gradually walk out of that paper and present a clearer image.
I create a link if I find it interesting, I create a page when I feel I have
something to say. I'm watching you.
