***** Research *****
     I am interested in modeling cortical structures in Neural Networks.
     Currently, I am working on a hand-written digit recognition system
     based on lateraly interconnected synergetically self organizing
     feature map(LISSOM:developed by Joseph_Sirosh and Prof._Risto
     Miikkulainen at UTCS_Neural_Networks_Research_Group. Recent work
     includes extending the LISSOM model to have actual spiking events.
     The new model called Spiking LISSOM (SLISSOM) can be self-organized
     as LISSOM and can segment multiple objects in the retina by
     synchronizing spikes within a group representing the same object, and
     desynchronizing spikes between groups representing different objects.
