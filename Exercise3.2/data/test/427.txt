Hi, I was born and brought up in Vietnam. After finishing high school in 1987,
I went to Hungary to study Computer Science. I graduated from Kossuth_Lajos
University_of_Arts_and_Sciences, Debrecen, Hungary, with a B.S. in 1993, and
received a M.S. -- also in Computer Science -- from the University_of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1995. Starting Fall 1996, I am in the Ph.D. program at
the Department_of_Computer_Science_and_Engineering, University_of_Washington-
Seattle.
My research interests are mostly in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently
investigating decision making under uncertainty, decision-theoretic planning,
Markov decision processes, and qualitative decision theory. Non-academic
interests include reading, traveling, and listening to music (mostly jazz and
blues).
An interesting thing about my first name, AnHai (meaning "calm sea" in
Vietnamese): It is made by combining the last syllable of the name of my
mother's birthplace, NgheAn, and the first syllable of the name of my father's
birthplace, HaiPhong. This shows how creative my folks were. Or so I thought up
to the birth of my younger brother, when they simply switched the two syllables
and gave him the name HaiAn. Hmm...
