I am currently working for Net_Scout_Services, a project of InterNIC. Wait!
Wait! We are not a part of Registration_Services. We couldn't help you with
your domain name problems even if we wanted to. InterNIC does a lot of neat
things with all its NSF and NSI money and Net Scout is one of those things. We
are located in the Computer_Sciences_Department at the University_of_Wisconsin
at_Madison. Seeing as how I could never explain what Net Scout does as
elegantly as our fearless leader, Susan_Calcari, check out the Net_Scout_web
page for an official explanation. I do some design and maintenance on our web
site and email list, the Scout_Report. I also assist Pete_DeVries with tech
support for our 5 macs, 1 PC and 2 UNIX machines.
Before coming to Net Scout, I spent two and a half years at the Laboratory_of
Molecular_Biology. Most of that time I was a full time student as well. At
Molecular Biology, I was what we called a Technical Support Assistant/Digital
Video Specialist. Which meant I had to run around fixing people's broken mice
and answering email questions most of the time, but when I was lucky, I got to
make cool videos. If you are interested in using digital video for
instructional purposes, check out my Multimedia_Services_web_page.
I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin's Philosophy_program, which
makes me a philosopher (and a real hot commodity in this capitalist society). I
also completed the requirements for the pre-med curriculum which makes me a
shameless pragmatist. So why am I here at the Computer Science Department?
Email me and we'll talk about it - It's been a while since I've had a good
metaphysical discussion.
Here are some links that serve no practical purpose, but they make this page
look more standard:
    * My_resume (not up-to-date)
    * My_multimedia_page_at_Molecular_Biology - explains how I made my
      animations (which have been shown all over the world and are a big hit
      among drosophila geneticists, I'm told.)
    * My_wonderful_girlfriend,_Amy's_page
    * Salon_Magazine - entertaining and informative ezine created and run
      completely on macs.
    * Laurie_Anderson's_Green_Room - if you have Shockwave, check out "Here"
    * Kudon's_page
    * Link_to_the_All-Knowing
    * Witness - A QuickTimeVR Documentary about the plight of Bosnia's uprooted
      population
    * The_Billie_Holiday_Homepage
    * The_National_Security_Archives - check out the Nixon/Presley meetings
