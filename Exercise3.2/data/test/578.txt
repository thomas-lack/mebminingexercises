[http://www.cs.washington.edu/general/sptm_s.gif] Ed Lazowska is Professor and
Chair of the Department_of_Computer_Science_&_Engineering at the University_of
Washington.
Lazowska received his A.B. from Brown_University in 1972, and has been at the
University of Washington since receiving his Ph.D. from the University_of
Toronto in 1977. His research concerns computer systems and computer system
performance. Recent specific topics have included parallel discrete-event
simulation, scheduling policies for multiprocessors, kernel structures to
support high-performance parallel computing, programming systems for networks
of multiprocessors, effective program performance monitoring tools for parallel
systems, the interaction of architecture and operating system design, hardware
and software techniques for high performance communication, and, most recently,
operating system and programming system support that exploits wide-address
architectures (Opal). Almost all of this work has actually been carried out by
terrific students, and has been supervised jointly with Hank_Levy or John
Zahorjan; Lazowska mostly wears_ties, pushes paper, and racks up frequent flier
miles. (The graduate students seem to have picked up on this (1.7Mb
Quicktime).) He also hosts lots of visitors, a surprising number of whom have
funny_noses.
Lazowska is a member of the Board of Directors of the Computing_Research
Association (CRA's members include essentially all graduate departments and
industrial research laboratories in the field), and Chair of CRA's_Government
Affairs_Committee. He serves on the National Science Foundation's Advisory
Committee for Computer_and_Information_Science_and_Engineering, and on the
National Research Council's Computer_Science_and_Telecommunications_Board. He
is a member of the 6-person Technical Advisory Board for Microsoft_Research, of
the 4-person National_Semiconductor_Computer_Science_&amp;_Systems_Academic
Advisory_Council, of the Board of Directors of Data_I/O_Corporation, and of the
Scientific Advisory Board for Cable &amp; Howse Ventures' Cascadia Fund. He
belongs to the standing advisory committees for the Department_of_EECS_at_UC
Berkeley and the Departments of Computer Science at Stanford_University, the
University_of_Virginia, and the Hong_Kong_University_of_Science_&amp;
Technology, and is a member of ACM's A.M._Turing_Award selection committee. He
has just completed service on a 12-person National Research Council panel
reviewing the multi-agency High_Performance_Computing_and_Communications
program (the "Brooks/Sutherland Committee"), and has recently served as Chair
of the Committee of Examiners for the Graduate Record Examinations Board
Computer Science Test, Chair of ACM SIGMETRICS (the Association for Computing
Machinery's Special Interest Group concerned with computer system performance),
Chair of the ACM Software Systems Award Committee, Program Chair of the 13th
ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, and editor of IEEE Transactions
on Computers.
At the University of Washington, in addition to serving as Chair of the
Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Lazowska is Chair of the
University Advisory Committee on Academic Technology. He has recently served as
a member of the Committee on the Deanship of the College of Arts and Sciences,
as Chair of the review committee for the Ph.D. program in Molecular
Biotechnology, and as a member of the performance review committee for the Dean
of Engineering. He was selected to deliver the 1996_University_of_Washington
Annual_Faculty_Lecture.
Lazowska is a Fellow of the Association_for_Computing_Machinery and of the
Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers. Seventeen Ph.D._students and
21 M.S. students have completed degrees working with him.
