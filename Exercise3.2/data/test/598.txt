===============================================================================
ZPL is a new array-based programming language suitable for most computations
that would previously have been written in Fortran 77:
    * ZPL programs run fast on sequential AND parallel computers, without
      modifications, and without special directives.
    * ZPL is machine-independent, so recompilation is all that is necessary to
      run a ZPL program on a new machine.
    * ZPL's higher level concepts like arrays, borders, etc. eliminate most of
      the error-prone indexing and tedious looping typical of F77, C, etc.
    * ZPL programs are shorter, more easily written, and more easily understood
      and modified.
    * Computer scientists will find new concepts in ZPL: regions, directions,
      borders, shattered control-flow, etc.
Conclusion: ZPL is ideal for new engineering and scientific programs.
Walk-through a small ZPL program, or write-compile-run a program from your
machine!

programmers in the area should consider enrolling in CSE_590ZP this autumn.
