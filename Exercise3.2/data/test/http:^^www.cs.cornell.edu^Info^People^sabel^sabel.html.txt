***** Professional Information *****
I did my doctoral research with Professor Keith_Marzullo, of the University of
California at San Diego, on failure detection in asynchronous distributed
systems. For more research on failure detectors, see Tushar_Chandra's_Failure
Detection_Page. I finally finished my thesis: Approximating Perfect Failure
Detectors in Asynchronous Distributed Systems.
