Brian_Bershad, Assistant Professor, has been at the University of Washington
since 1986. After receiving his PhD from the University of Washington in 1990,
he took a brief respite from Seattle between 1990 and 1993 to experiment with
post-industrial culture in the Northeast. In 1993, he returned to the Northwest
for the coffee.
Bershad does research in operating systems, distributed systems, networking,
parallel systems, and architecture. A lot of his work has appeared in TOCS,
SOSP, ASPLOS and ISCA, although he can't seem to get a SIGMETRICS paper
published to save his life.
Besides working, Bershad runs, plays squash, and hangs out on the stairmaster.
