But failing that, my fallback plan is to write a few games.
BattleBall(223k) is now accessible through this page! The binary executable
file is for the AIX 3.2 operating system, and unfortunately that's the only OS
for which it's available (I want to port it to SunOS/Solaris, but I'm working
and going to school...who has the time?)
BattleBall is a 3-D multiplayer game I wrote which runs under X Windows. It's
about 7000 lines of C++ code that uses the C++ Standard_Template_Library and A.
T._Campbell's Binary Space Partition (BSP) tree library. The image at the top
of this page is a screenshot from BattleBall.
I'm a student here at the University_of_Texas at Austin in the (you guessed it)
Computer_Sciences_department. I'm interested in two research areas:
**** Geometric modeling/graphics ****
    * the_BSP_tree - a really cool geometric model, and my main research
      interest
    * CS_384G_Computer_Graphics
**** Software reuse/engineering ****
    * Software_Systems_Generator_Research_Group
    * CS_395T_Automatic_Programming
