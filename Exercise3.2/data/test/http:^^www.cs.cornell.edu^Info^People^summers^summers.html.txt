***** Research Interests *****
I work with the Information_Capture_and_Access research group on document
analysis. My long-term goal is to provide support for sophisticated electronic
document manipulation tools for indexing, browsing, linking, etc.
My primary interest is in discovering logical structure in arbitrary electronic
documents. The goal is to take an electronic document representation as input
and return a hierarchy of logical pieces of the document as output. For
example, given a scanned-in or postscript version of a technical report, I
would like to be able to divide it into sections, paragraphs, etc. Similarly,
in a business letter, the address headings, body, and closing should be
identifiable.
This problem has two primary components: segmentation (dividing the document
into logical pieces) and classification (categorizing the pieces). It also
raises the questions of evaluation (previous work differs in descriptions of
the correct hierarchy), types of logical structures, and theoretical
limitations.
The task is relevant to two of Bruce Croft's top_10_research_issues_for
information_retrieval (in the November_1995_issue of D-Lib_Magazine): number 5,
"interfaces and browsing," and number 3, "efficient, flexible, indexing and
retrieval." Determining logical structure enables flexible, hierarchical
browsing; doing so in a general way supports system flexibility and handling of
multiple document types.
