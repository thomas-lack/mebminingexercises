****** Cornell Modeling and Simulation Project ******
Enormous effort is currently expended in creating scientific software,
particularly for simulating physical systems defined on complex geometries, and
when using advanced computing hardware. The goal of the SimLab project is to
reduce this effort by bringing together technologies such as geometric
modeling, symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, compilation/code
generation, and formal methods to create tools that raise the semantic level at
which it is possible to create scientific software.
