 Before I started drinking 8 cups of coffee a day, my hair was limp and lacked
                                     body.

After six years of living the good life as a graduate student, I finally
finished my doctorate in computer_graphics. For the fall quarter I will do a
post doc here at the UW. Early in 1997 I will join the Computer_Science
Department at Princeton_University.
From 1987 to 1990, I was a software engineer at TIBCO (formerly Teknekron
Software Systems) in Palo Alto; I wrote software for people who trade stock.
Before that, I was an undergraduate student at Swarthmore_College (class of 87)
where I studied physics, occasionally.
