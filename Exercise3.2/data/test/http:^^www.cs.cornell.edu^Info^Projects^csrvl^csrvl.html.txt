===============================================================================
Welcome to the Web niche of the Cornell Robotics and Vision Laboratory. cp: No
match. match. rrently under development; please don your hard hat. Questions
and comments should be directed to mdw@cs.cornell.edu. Thanks.
***** About the CSRVL *****
The Cornell Computer Science Robotics and Vision Laboratory is located at
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. We have three main areas of research:
    * Computer vision (Prof._Daniel_Huttenlocher)
    * Multimedia applications of computer vision (Prof._Ramin_Zabih)
    * Robotics, including distributed manipulation and micro-electro mechanical
      systems (MEMS) (Prof._Bruce_Donald)
Here is a pictoral tour of the CSRVL.

Current Projects *****
The following projects are active at the CSRVL. They are supervised by Ramin
Zabih.
    * Automatic_Detection_and_Classification_of_Scene_Breaks_in_Digital_Video.
    * MPEG_Browser, allowing scene break and global motion-based queries.
    * Real-time_ATM_Video_Source, transmission of full-frame video over ATM for
      parallel computation on platforms such as the Cornell/NYNET_ATM_Cluster.
    * A number of projects involving high-performance imaging applications.
      These include parallel implementations in Split-C for U-Net and symmetric
      multiprocessors.
We have a list of potential Master's projects, maintained by Justin_Miller.
Most of our work has been done under Unix, but we are currently considering a
move to WindowsNT. There is a discussion of some of the issues here. We are
hopeful that this move will be supported by Microsoft.
