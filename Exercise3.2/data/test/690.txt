     They say that heaven
     is like TV.
     A perfect little world
     that doesn't really need you.
     And everything there
     is made of light.
- Laurie Anderson, Strange Angels

     Note: Where possible, these pages make use of structural markup. By
     indicating what a piece of information is, rather than how it should
     look, I have made the information in these pages more accessible to
     people who don't use bitmapped displays, including the blind. By
     using standard markup tags I am allowing you to use whatever browser
     you wish to.
     Also note: These pages make use of the age-old literary conventions
     irony, satire and sarcasm, but nothing contained herein is meant to
     be offensive. If you are offended, it's probably because you're
     stupid.

I have just started my third year as a graduate student in the Computer
Sciences_Department. I was a TA for the first two weeks, but since then I've
supported myself by taking care of a variety of machines, with varying degrees
of success.
On the graduate student side, I've never been published, nor have I ever done
anything impressive. If by some miracle I pass my prelim, my research will add
up to a hill of beans or, more likely, fizzle out before any results are
obtained. This will probably leave me as a junior-level programmer creating
kiosk front-ends in Visual J++ until primitive AI systems leave me permanently
skill-free.
To my surprise, about a year ago I discovered I was gay. This was especially
surprising because I wasn't that convinced I was alive. Those who know me well
would probably argue that my being gay is no proof of my being alive. Anyway,
you might want to read my thoughts_on_being_a_hedgehog.
The only way of contacting me is by electronic mail or pager. I am not reliably
at any specific location and often work from home. If you would like to see me
in person, write me and we can set something up. My address is
keeper@cs.wisc.edu. If it becomes clear you'll want to contact me on short
notice, I'll give you my pager number.
Various creations:
    * Thoughts_on_being_a_hedgehog
    * My_todo_list (updated sporadically)
    * A_list_of_some_associates
    * My_résumé (in PostScript)
    * My_Web_documentation (the HTML section is long out of date,
      unfortunately)
    * The_DANEnet/DILHR_JobNet_Database (soon to be defunct)
    * The Caltech Projects:
          o The_Caltech_Institute_Archives_PhotoNet_Database
          o The_Caltech_Personnel_Directory (this looks much better from inside
            Caltech)
          o The_Caltech_WWW_Database (inside Caltech anyone can enter their own
            pages into the database using a Forms interface)
    * Some slides:
          o Slides_from_a_talk_I_gave_on_the_Web
          o Slides_from_a_talk_I_gave_on_distributed_objects
          o Slides_from_a_talk_I_gave_called_``Java_and_the_Dangers_of_Love''
Coming when hell freezes over, at this rate:
    * I'll add more information to this page and break it up into a hierarchy
    * I do some consulting. I'll put some information about that somewhere.
    * The Steven Fought Unified Attribution Index (SFUAI). In the information
      age, intellectual property is everything. This index will allow me to
      assign a unique serial number to all the references I quote (such as the
      one at the top of this page) and provide the quote, source, contextual
      information, and pointers to other relevant quotes in the index.
    * When the lab buys Adobe Distiller, I'll translate my résumé into PDF so
      more than 0.1% of the world's WWW users will have a chance of reading it
      (I suppose more than that can print it in a pinch).
    * I want to do some writing about using computers. There are certain truths
      about the psychology of using computer software that people eventually
      pick up on, but that aren't ever taught explicitly. I think it's possible
      to do so, and it would make starting to use computers easier.
    * Cheap shots at things I hate.
    * A set of project ideas I've been mulling over, probably only accessible
      to a very small subset of WWW users. It's a tough world out there.
