***** Overview *****
The Database Environment for Vision Research was designed as a general
scientific database system, but motivated by and intended for use in model-
based computer vision. We provide a unified data model, a highly graphical user
interface, an advanced query facility and an interactive laboratory notebook.
The Database Environment for Vision Research aids in scientific experimentation
and promotes data sharing in the computer vision community.

In DEVR, entities are stored in hierarchical, relational data structures. The
schema for each entity contains a name, a set of properties, a set of parts, a
set of attributed relations among the parts and a set of graphic definitions
which describe how to build instance-specific visualizations.
*** We are studying many different image database research topics including:
