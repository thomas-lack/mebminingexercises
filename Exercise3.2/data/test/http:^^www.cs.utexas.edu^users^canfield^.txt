***** Business *****
    * My resume (postscript).
    * In Spring 1996 I had to give a report to my EE382C ("Software for Highly-
      Available Distributed Systems") class. The slides talk about efforts to
      use RT-Mach to implement some of Flaviu_Cristian's distributed algorithms
      (work done for Prof._Al_Mok; built on some work by Guangtian_Liu).
    * I am currently working on a hardware verification project at IBM in the
      RS/6000 division. It ties in with my Ph.D research under Professor Allen
      Emerson.
***** Pleasure *****
    * Domestic_bliss department: photos of my wife Carla and our newborn
      daughter Ruth Claire (3/13/96).
    * Before parenthood struck, travel and beer were high priorities. Somewhere
      between the two lies the enjoyment I get from peeling beer_labels off of
      bottles in foreign lands.
***** Humor from various sources *****
    * The Sofasphere_II project.
    * Some haikus about Olestra, the new FDA-approved fat substitute.
    * Speaking of poetry... here is an interesting ode to women.
    * Some disinformation about Bob_Dole.
