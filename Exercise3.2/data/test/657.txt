This is my continually-tweaked homepage. Thanks for stopping by.
I collect images that I find on the web and deposit them into a directory.
(Samples below.)
Sample: here's a picture of some guys who were once claimed to be cooler_than
you_are (according to Onion). Did you see this movie? (It's The Usual
Suspects.) If not, run, don't walk, to the nearest Blockbuster and get it.
Note: I recently moved, and none of my new roommates have a VCR. Being Dutch,
I'm so cheap that I don't have one either. Given this predicament, and the
dismal prospects of improvement (with no outside influence, that is), please
consider making a small donation to help defray the cost of a VCR purchase.
Checks and money orders can be sent to the following address. Please, send no
cash.

Thank you for your support.
Being a grad student, I sometimes find myself reading papers, even though I
have two shelf-feet of unread books waiting to be read. Anyhow, if you're
looking for something, here's Alf-Christian Achilles's huge_index. You might
also try the Unified_CS_techreports index.  [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~gid/

If you run the following program, your machine's load average will grow big
fast:
main()_{_while_(1)_fork();_}

this on a big time-sharing machine back when I was at Calvin.
A great time-killer: see what Zippy_the_Pinhead has to say. Try reloading it
several times (or just try_this).

Last fall (1995) we killed time by tweaking_netscape, but nothing (I think) we
did works on Mozilla 2.0 or higher. Oh well. Before that I dabbled in object-
oriented programming in_C, mostly as an exercise. I suppose I should have a
Netscape button here, but that MS-thing over to the right will have to suffice.

In case you're here because I told you about something in my bookmarks, there
they are.
