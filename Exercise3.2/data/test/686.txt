**** Research Summary ****
I am interested in the performance analysis of DBMS operations on advanced tape
and disk technology, including disk and tape arrays. I'm currently studying how
to buffer large datasets from tertiary storage to disk and memory when such
data are used for data exploration and visualization (the DEVise project). My
advisor is Prof. Miron_Livny.
My recent work includes improving the performance of relational joins of large
volumes of disk and tape-resident data (see publication list below), and
applying a log-structured organization to tertiary storage to solve problems
associated with the diverse characteristics and functional limitations of
tertiary media. Our recent paper on data visualization and exploration
discusses data and metadata management issues when large and complex data sets
are involved.
