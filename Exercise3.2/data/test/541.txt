About Me:
Stefan was born in Cologne, Germany in Spring of 1973. In 1989, he completed
his Mittlere Reife (10th grade) at the Schillergymnasium in Cologne before
coming to the United States to receive a high school diploma from Bloomington
High School North (Indiana) in 1991. Stefan received his Bachelor of Science
with honors and distinction in the field of computer_science from Indiana
University in 1994. At the moment he is working towards a PhD at the University
of_Washington with an expected completion date sometime this century.

Print Yourself

Something crazy I did. I didn't even come up with this particular solution
myself, but the implementation was done by me. It's all on one line and
shouldn't contain a trailing carriage return (384 bytes). Compiles without
warning with gcc. If you run it, this program will print it's exact source
code. If you can do it in fewer bytes in C, I'd like to see it!
v(c){putchar(c);}u(char*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34
)v(*x);else{v(92);v(34);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}
char x[]={37,115,0};main(){char*b="v(c){putchar(c);}u(ch
ar*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34)v(*x);else{v(92);v(3
4);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}char x[]={37,115,0};m
ain(){char*b=\"\0\";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,
b);}\0";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,b);}
Stefan's resume is available in postscript, dvi, and TeX format.
