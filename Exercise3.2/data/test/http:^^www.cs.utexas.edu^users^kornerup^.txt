Welcome to my home page !
I am a Ph.D. student in candidacy in the Department_of_Computer_Sciences at The
University_of_Texas_at_Austin.
****** Research ******
My dissertation is on Powerlists, a functional notation for describing
synchronous parallel algorithms. In this work I study how the notation can be
mapped efficiently onto different parallel architectures, including hypercubes
and meshes. My advisor is Jayadev_Misra, who invented the powerlist notation
and heads the PSP_group here at UT. For more information about my research see
my list_of_papers.
****** Teaching ******
[Faculty]In the spring and fall semesters of 1995 I taught CS_105_C++
Programming in the Department_of_Computer_Sciences at The_University_of_Texas
at_Austin.

***** My Hotlist *****
Some frequently-used or interesting WWW nodes I've run across:
    * PSP group: To make our work available the PSP group (Dr. Misra, Will
      Adams, Al Carruth, Markus Kaltenbach and me) has created a home_page. PSP
      stands for Programs, Specifications and Proofs
    * Formal Methods One of my professional goals is to promote the use of
      formal methods by introducing them early on in the undergraduate
      curriculum. A good place to learn more about this is the Formal_Methods
      home page at Oxford.
      Some very good arguments for using formal methods can be made after
      reading the ARIANE_5_Flight_501_Failure_Report or looking at my_page_of
      quotes_that_support_the_use_of_formal_methods.
    * The Computer Science Departments Home Page Our department has a home_page
      with access to web pages for students, staff and faculty. It also has
      access to The_University's_web_server.
    * CS Tech Reports & Bibliographies:  For access to a collection of
      technical reports have a look at The_New_Zealand_Digital_Library.
      The_Collection_of_Computer_Science_Bibliographies is a comprehensive
      collection of bibliographies in computer science. Hey, I even have
      entries there :-)
    * Volleyball info: Look at Volleyball_WorldWide for useful info about a
      great sport. You used to be able go over to Gregory Gym, here on the UT
      campus, where you could find pictures of the mostly CS Grad/Law/faculty/
      staff intermural champs of 91, 92 and 95, and runners-up of 93 and 94
      High Voltage Spikes and Last Minute.
****** A Great Day for the First Amendment ******
News flash (June 11 1996): The indecency provision in the newly passed
Telecommunication Bill has been ruled unconstitutional by a three member panel
of federal judges. For details see the EFF's blue_ribbon_campaign.
On February 8, 1996 the Telecommunication Bill was signed into law, making it
criminal to transmit indecent material over the net. This means that our
freedom of speech was limited to what does not offend anyone in Round Rock, TX
or Salt Lake City, UT.
Please support the Electronic_Frontier_Foundation_(EFF) and other organizations
in their fight against this law. You can support this effort by including the
blue_ribbon on your page.
