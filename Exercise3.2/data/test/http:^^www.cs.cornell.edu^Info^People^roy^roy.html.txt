I am a post-doctoral associate in the Department_of_Computer_Science at Cornell
University. I am working with Ken_Birman and Robbert_Van_Rennesse in the area
of distributed systems, mainly on the Horus project.
I received my D.Sc. from the Department_of_Computer_Science at the Technion_-
Israel_Institute_of_Technology. My advisor was Hagit_Attiya, and my thesis
title was Consistency_Conditions_for_Distributed_Shared_Memories.
I am currently also involved in the Millipede project, working with Assaf
Schuster from the Department_of_Computer_Science at the Technion_-_Israel
