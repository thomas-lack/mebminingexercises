Research activities of the laboratory span the entire development cycle of
network protocols, from design and specification, to verification, testing,
performance analysis, implementation, and performance tuning. Of current
interest are new architectures and protocols that address changes in underlying
communications technology as well as in networked applications.
Laboratory research projects are supervised by Simon_S._Lam, Professor of
Computer Sciences. Research funding has been provided by National Science
Foundation, NSA University Research Program, Texas Advanced Research Program,
ATT Foundation, and Lockheed.
