                           ***** Announcements *****
    * (11/14/96) A pre-release version of the new CODE is now available (and
      it's FREE)! Click here to download the software.
      This is a major new revision of CODE (click here for a_screen_shot). It
      features a sophisticated new user-interface which provides many
      improvements to the previous version of CODE, making it easier and more
      pleasant to use. Some of the features include a Mac-like interface (Ã  la
      MacDraw), multiple windows for subgraph editing, a hierarchy browser and
      more.
(10/8/96) Article on CODE: HPCwire, the on-line journal of high-performance
computing, recently published an article on CODE entitled "Visual_Parallel
Programming_May_Come_of_Age_with_CODE" that they've been kind enough to let us
reproduce here.
There is a CODE mailing-list for current (and prospective) CODE users so that
they will be notified of releases, new backends, etc.
To join the mailing list, fill in the form below. (If you download_CODE, you
will also be added to the mailing list.)

                    **** Documentation_&_Publications ****
 These directories of compressed PostScript files are documentation for the
previous version of CODE, but are being made available in lieu of new
documentation, which is in the preparation stages. Despite the changes in the
user interface, these manuals are still quite useful.
    * CODE_2.0_User's_Manual
    * CODE_2.0_Reference_Manual
Here is a listing of CODE-related publications, including links to PostScript
versions of most of them.
