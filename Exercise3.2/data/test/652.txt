***** Research Summary *****
I am looking at robust methods for solving large-scale variational inequality
and nonlinear programming problems with applications to problems in economics
and engineering. Pivotal and path-following techniques are being investigated,
based on successive linearization, with emphasis on numerical properties for
large-scale problems and interfaces to modeling languages. Particular
applications being considered include economic equilibria and the effects of
taxation on carbon emissions, traffic congestion and the effects of tolling,
structural optimization, contact problems and chemical process design.
I have been considering the use of parallel architectures for solving problems
in nonlinear optimization. The use of graph partitioning techniques to
determine underlying structure is being investigated as a tool for general
purpose parallel optimization. Techniques for exploiting parallel machines
directly from within modeling systems are also under consideration, with
prototypes using the condor system.
Extensions of the complementarity framework are also being investigated, with
emphasis on identifying and exploiting underlying model structure.
