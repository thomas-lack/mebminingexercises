***** About Me *****
I am an educator and a computer scientist. I am very interested in
understanding how people learn what they learn. I am particularly interested in
the learning of mathematical logic and formal methods. My doctoral research was
on the topic of Limitations_in_the_Understanding_of_Mathematical_Logic_by
Novice_Computer_Science_Students.
I am a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, I spent the
fall semester of 1995 teaching in Uppsala Sweden. My home_page there is a link
into that university.
Other interests include encouraging others to excel in mathematics and computer
science, gardening, travel, crafts such as sewing and woodworking, etc. Here's
