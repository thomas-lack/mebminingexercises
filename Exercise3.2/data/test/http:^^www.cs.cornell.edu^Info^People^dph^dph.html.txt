Research...         My main area of research is visual matching and recognition. My work in this
                    area ranges from theoretical algorithms (using techniques from computational
                    geometry), to applications of visual matching in end-to-end systems (for remote
                    collaboration, viewing document images over wide area networks, video monitoring
                    and target recognition). I am also interested in uses of new types of electronic
                    documents for communication, remote collaboration and education.

Teaching...         Brian Smith and I are developing a new course on authoring Web documents,CS130,
                    which will be offered for the first time in Spring '97. I also teachCS212, an
                    introduction to computation and programming, andCS664, a course in computer
                    vision.
Professional        I work with XeroxPARCon electronic document image processing, and am starting a
Activities...       small group investigating these problems at Cornell.
                    I am program co-chair ofCVPR-97, the IEEE conference on computer vision and
                    pattern recognition, which will be held in San Juan, PR in June 1997.
Other Interests...  Two of my favorite non-computer-geek activities are snowboarding and mountain
                    biking (but without the mtv-extreme-sports-way-too-cool stupid attitude).
