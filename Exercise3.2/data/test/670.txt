***** Research Summary *****
My work mainly involves the design and implementation of language-based
programming tools that help programmers with problems like:
    * understanding how existing programs work, and how they would be affected
      by proposed modifications;
    * understanding the textual, structural, and semantic differences between
      two versions of a program;
    * retesting a program after changing it;
    * combining pieces of old programs to produce a new program, with certain
      semantic guarantees.
This work has involved the use of a program representation called the program
dependence graph (PDG), and an operation called slicing.
I am also working on new algorithms for precise, interprocedural dataflow
analysis. Previous work on interprocedural dataflow analysis mainly
concentrated either on efficient algorithms for specific individual problems,
or on (not necessarily efficient) algorithms for a general class of problems.
Thomas Reps, Mooly Sagiv, and I have developed and implemented a new algorithm
that is both efficient, and applies to a large class of problems.
