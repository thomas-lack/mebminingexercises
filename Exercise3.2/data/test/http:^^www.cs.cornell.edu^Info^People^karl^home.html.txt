My current research interests are micro robotics, manipulation, and assembly.
At the Cornell_Nanofabrication_Facility I am building microfabricated_actuator
arrays that implement micro_manipulation_strategies. More generally I am
interested in new_devices_for_handling and assembling_parts, and manipulation
strategies with programmable_force_vector_fields. I have also investigated
design_automation_for_micro_structures.
Earlier work at the University_of_Karlsruhe, Germany, has included the
development of better graph_layout_algorithms.
My thesis advisor is Professor Bruce_Donald, who is one of the founders and
directors of the Cornell Computer_Science_Robotics_and_Vision_Laboratory. My
project is in close collaboration with Professor Noel_MacDonald and his
research_group.

If I am not in my office or the Nano_Lab, I may be working out in our Tae_Kwon
Do club, or you may find me at the Lindseth climbing wall.
