Here is some personal_information.
***** What I do: *****
My research has concentrated on the interaction between applications and
operating systems. I implemented an operating system mechanism that allowed
applications to implement their own page replacement policy when the kernel's
policy caused them to perform poorly.
After that, I helped implement "scheduler activations" in the Mach operating
system. Scheduler activations are a mechanism that help user-level threads
systems interact properly with the kernel thread scheduler.
These experiences lead me to work with the SPIN_project folks, who are building
a new operating system architecture that generalizes the idea of application-
tailorable operating systems.
My current work carries on the research started in the Opal_project. My thesis
is investigating the interaction between Object-oriented databases (OODBs) and
operating system virtual memory. This work is demonstrating that significant
improvements in performance can be achived using commodity operating systems,
but in a different way than is currently done. Additional improvements can come
from modifying the operating system slightly to better serve OODBs.

Geoff Voelker and I built this web for the Winter 96 quarter of the 590S
systems seminar, which was dedicated to Java. I gave a lecture introducing the
Java language and environment. Here are the slides_I_used.
