That's me, in my Navy uniform. Currently I am a Master of Engineering student
in Computer_Science at the College of Engineering, Cornell University. This
semester I am a teaching assistant for COMS_664_Machine_Vision. During the day
(and many, many long nights), I can be found in the Robotics_and_Vision_Lab
(CSRVL), where I am a research assistant working for Prof._Ramin_Zabih. My
primary research interest is Machine Vision, particularly low-level image
processing.
