Professor Shapiro's research interests center on relationships between geometry
and physical phenomena, so that mechanical artifacts can be modeled,
represented, analyzed, manipulated, designed, and manufactured based on
computer representations and algorithms.
  Some specific ongoing projects include:
  Geometric Modeling:
      Ability to create, convert between, and to maintain consistency of
      distinct representations of mechanical parts is a major technological
      barrier that undermines the usefulness and reliability of commercial
      geometric modeling systems. Current research efforts focus on eliminating
      ambiguity in communicating engineering specifications, formal modeling of
      parametric families of mechanical parts, and investigating novel methods
      and computational techniques in support of design and manufacturing.
  Mechanical Design:
      Today mechanical forms, functions, and fabrication processes cannot be
      described combinatorially, in terms of discrete, simple, and interacting
      primitives; this apparent lack of combinatorial structure is a major
      roadblock for competitive design and manufacturing of mechanical systems.
      In collaboration with industry, the present research deals with
      theoretical, practical, and computational aspects of mechanical design
      and seeks to establish a formal basis for making mechanical design and
      manufacturing of parts more systematic and competitive, and for smooth
      integration of mechanical form modeling with other engineering
      activities.
  Physical Modeling:
      Geometric models contain only part of the information needed to capture
      the desired physical behavior of an artifact, and the processes used to
      manufacture it. Recent study of algebraic topological models (so called
      "chain models") of physical behavior suggests that it may be possible to
      unify physical and geometric modeling and thus facilitate development of
      new computer-aided engineering tools. Current investigations use these
      and other models of physical behavior to develop new engineering
      languages and computer algorithms for systematic specification, modeling,
      simulation, and analysis of physical objects and systems.
