***** Research Interests *****
    * There is a growing need for exploratory analysis of very large datasets
      to discover useful patterns, and data mining is the new territory
      developed for this purpose. I am very interested in designing new
      efficient data mining algorithms or tools for very large databases by
      integrating the techniques of databases, artificial intelligence and
      statistics.
    * My Ph.D thesis topic is on clustering and density analysis of very large
      datasets. That is, given a very large multi-dimensional dataset, and a
      limited amount of resources (e.g., running time and memory), design and
      implement algorithms to efficiently and accurately (1) identify the
      sparse and crowded regions (clustering analysis), (2) estimate the
      density function of the overall data distribution (density analysis).
      They are very important and practical branches of data mining, and can be
      applied to many domains such as, data classification, image compression
      and pattern recognition.
