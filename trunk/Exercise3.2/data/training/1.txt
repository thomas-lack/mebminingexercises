****** Who am I? ******
I was a Ph.D. student (1991-1996) in the Center_for_Applied_Mathematics, which
is housed in Frank_H.T._Rhodes_Hall at Cornell_University. My thesis advisor
was Steve_Vavasis. Other members of my committee were Nick_Trefethen and Al
Schatz. My research interests fall in the areas of
    * [o] numerical linear algebra
    * [o] scientific computing
    * [o] optimization
I am currently working as a postdoc with Juan_Meza in the Scientific_Computing
Department at Sandia_National_Laboratories in Livermore, CA.
Here is my resume and a statement_of_research_goals.
