***** Research Interests *****
The research in my group concentrates on modeling cognitive processes with
artificial neural networks. Current work includes models of language
acquisition, episodic memory, self-organization of the visual cortex, and
schema-based vision. We are also working on evolving neural networks with
genetic algorithms, where the goal is to automatically discover sequential
decision strategies for problem solving and robotics. For more details, see the
UTCS_Neural_Networks_Research_Group_home_page.
