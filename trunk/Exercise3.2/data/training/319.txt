Welcome to my home page. You have reached the web address of Dr._Nell_B._Dale,
retired Senior Lecturer in Computer Sciences at the University_of_Texas_at
Austin. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Sciences in 1972 from UT Austin and
have been on the faculty here since 1975. I retired from full-time teaching in
the summer of 1994. I now teach a full load each Fall and spend the Spring and
Summer writing and traveling.

Please feel free to browse in any of my rooms: the resume_room, which contains
my curriculum_vita, the bibliography_room, which contains information on the
text books I have authored or co-authored, the research_room, which contains
abstracts of dissertations that I have co-chaired recently, and the personal
room, which contains mementos of my nontechnical interests.

Please direct any correspondence to my e-mail account:ndale@cs.utexas.edu.
