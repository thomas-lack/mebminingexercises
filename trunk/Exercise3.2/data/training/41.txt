***** Research Interests *****
Although my research spans a number of subfields within artificial
intelligence, including machine learning, case-based reasoning, and cognitive
modeling, the focus of my research is in the area of natural language
understanding (NLP/NLU). The NLP group at Cornell is primarily interested in
investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding
natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that
underly language acquisition. Our work focuses on two related areas: (1) the
design of user-trained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the
important information from a document, and (2) the machine learning of natural
language.
    * Information_Extraction.
      As part of Cornell's CSTR project, we are using information extraction
      techniques to support content-based browsing of technical texts.
    * The_Kenmore_Project.
      The focus of the Kenmore project is on developing techniques to automate
      the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building of any NLP
      system. Very generally, Kenmore acquires linguistic knowledge using a
      combination of symbolic machine learning techniques and robust sentence
      analysis. It has been used with corpora from two real-world domains to
      perform part-of-speech tagging, semantic feature tagging, and concept
      activation and to find the antecedents of relative pronouns. In current
      work, we are extending Kenmore to handle larger text corpora and
      additional disambiguation tasks. In all of our work, we evaluate the
      language learning components in the context of the larger NLP application
      in which it is embedded. The goal of the project is to determine the
      conditions under which machine learning techniques can be expected to
      offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP systems.
