***** Research Summary *****
My research targets the memory systems of shared-memory multiprocessors and
high-performance uniprocessors. Memory system design is important, because it
largely determines a computer's sustained performance. My work emphasizes
quantitative analysis (often requiring new evaluation techniques) of system-
level (not just hardware) performance.
Much of my recent work is part of the Wisconsin_Wind_Tunnel_Projectwith Profs.
Larus and Wood and many students. The project expects most future massively-
parallel computers will be built from workstation-like nodes and programmed in
high-level parallel languages--like HPF--that support a shared address space in
which processes uniformly reference data. Our research seeks to develop a
consensus about the middle-level interface--below languages and compilers and
above system software and hardware. We have recently proposed the Tempest
interface that enables programmers, compilers, and program libraries to
implement and use message passing, transparent shared memory, and hybrid
combinations of the two. We are developing Tempest implementations on a
Thinking Machines CM-5, a cluster of workstations (COW), and hypothetical
hardware platforms. The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project is so named because we
use our tools to cull the design space of parallel supercomputers in a manner
similar to how aeronautical engineers use conventional wind tunnels to design
airplanes.
Other recent work with Madhu_Talluri targets improving translation lookaside
buffer (TLB) and page table performance by clustering aligned groups of base
pages. Options require changes to hardware only (complete-subblocked TLBs),
operating system only (clustered page tables), or both (superpages and partial-
subblocked TLBs). See our ASPLOS and SOSP papers.
