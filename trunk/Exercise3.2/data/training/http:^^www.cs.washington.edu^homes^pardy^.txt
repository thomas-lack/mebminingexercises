===============================================================================
I am a third year graduate student of Computer Science at the University of
Washington. Currently, I do research in the area of operating systems but I am
also interasted in distributed systems, languages, and compilers. Besides grad
school, my life is filled with the Seattle drizzle, hiking and other outdoors
activities (if I am not busy enjoying the school or the drizzle), books and
music. You can find a short description of my research interests and a resume
here. There's also a list of my papers. All of these are a bit outdated but
that's what happens when one has a busy schedule.
