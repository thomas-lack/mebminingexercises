[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/gjb/images/construction.gif] Hello, and
welcome to my WWW homepage. Please feel free to send feedback to the above
email address. This page is (and always will be, I suppose) under construction
so keep checking back for new and exciting features.
I'm a recent graduate of Duke_University. I completed my B.S. degree as a
double major in computer science and mathematics in the spring of 1995. I am
currently employed part-time as a senior research scientist for Transworld
Numerics, Inc., a small company originally located in Durham, NC, with its
headquarters in Bermuda. I now work from my apartment in Seattle, Washington. I
am also a full time graduate student in the computer science and engineering
department at the University_of_Washington.
