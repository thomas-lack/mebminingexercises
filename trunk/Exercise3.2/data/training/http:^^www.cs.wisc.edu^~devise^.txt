***** Features *****
These features distinguish DEVise from other visualization environments:
    * Visual query interface: Visualizations constructed with one set of data
      may be saved and applied to other input data.
    * Data larger than memory are efficiently handled.
    * Mapping from data to graphics at record level. (e.g., you can control the
      color or shape of individual records.)
    * Ability to query data records used to represent graphics.
    * Flexible layout mechanisms within windows. It helps user group data
      together for comparison, or put the aside when not needed.
    * Linked X, Y, or X and Y axes.
    * Cursor helps compare the relationship between different views of the
      data.
    * Record based input data.
    * Direct input of ASCII files.
    * Integer, float, date, and string data types.

***** Related Work *****
 The SEQ project is complementary to DEVise in that it is designed to query
record based sequenced data. The output of the queries may be visualized with
DEVise.
***** Release Information *****
 We are currently releasing version 1.1.8 of DEVise. The executables for the
Solaris platforms are dynamically linked so you need to set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable appropriately to run DEVise. On all other
supported architectures, the executables are statically linked and require no
shareable libraries at run time.
