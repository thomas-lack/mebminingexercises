       The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a
       suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for
       life. For this task it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it
       finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain any more
       so it eats it. It's rather like getting tenure.

**** Research ****
I'm currently working on building a high-speed, low-latency LAN from Chaotic
Routers (see below). My previous research has been on Chaotic_Routing, which is
a form of non-minimal adaptive routing for massively parallel multicomputers.

**** About me ****
*** Professional ***
I am an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Seattle_Pacific
University. I'm also working part time as a research associate at the
University of Washington. All significant papers I've written are in the
archives of the Chaotic Routing group.
I spend most of my time teaching Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seattle
Pacific_University.
*** Personal ***
Here are some photos I took of the comet_Hyakutake from Seattle.
No, the moustache isn't real.
In case you want to visit me at home, here is a map.
I have another home_page at SPU.
