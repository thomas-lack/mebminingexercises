I am a Post-Doctorate Associate working with Professor Tim_Teitelbaum.
***** Research Interests *****
General systematic approaches to improving the efficiency of computations.
Program analysis and transformation techniques for incremental computation and
parallel/concurrent computation. Applications in optimizing compilers,
language-based interactive systems, algorithm design, program development,
software system organization, and software maintenance.
