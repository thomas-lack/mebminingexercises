***** Finally... *****
After receiving countless flames and gripes about the excessive verbosity of my
home page, I have decided to bow to the collective wish of the masses (it's a
democratic world) and put only the barest minimum out here. Adieu, my
outpourings ! All you critics out there (headed by Plakal and Hags), I hope you
sleep easy with untroubled consciences after sending a perfectly good home page
to an untimely demise. (Actually, not quite. For those who want to see what
kind of web page could merit such vitriol, click here at your own risk.)
Maybe your comments can help reinstate my earlier page ! Do sign in here. To
