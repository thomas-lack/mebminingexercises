[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ball-t.gif] Objective:
The goal of the Condor project is to develop, implement, deploy, and evaluate
mechanisms and policies that support High Throughput Computing (HTC) on large
collections of distributively owned computing resources. Guided by both the
technological and sociological challenges of such a computing environment, the
Condor Team has been building software tools that enable scientists and
engineers to increase their computing throughput.
