  "It is almost a miracle that modern teaching methods have not yet entirely
 strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; for what this delicate little plant
          needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom."
"I think life would really be empty if one is deprived of opportunities, if one
   always has to choose alternatives to his distaste, or if one is denied of
 actualization of his little wish or aspiration under a fearful duress of the
 "fate". I would think such a life is not much different from that of a car, a
                         truck, or a washing machine."

Nice to meet you here.
