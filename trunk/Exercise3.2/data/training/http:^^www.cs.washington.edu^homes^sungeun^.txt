                                        My primary research interest is in
                                        compiling parallel programming
                                        languages. I am involved in the ZPL
                                        Compiler Project at the University of
                                        Washington. Lately, I've been spending
                                        most of my time thinking about
                                        optimized communication_generation
                                        using the ZPL architechture-independent
                                        communication library, IRONMAN. In
                                        addition, I am experimenting with
****** MY SCHOOL LIFE ******            simulating data parallel programs on
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/    superscalar processors. The goal of
sungeun/pictures/sungeun.school.gif]    this work is to improve node
                                        performance on the coming generations
                                        of parallel machines. I've also been
                                        seen hanging out with the Chaos Router
                                        group. I did a bit of work on the
                                        simulator, including a graphical front
                                        end for visualization. With that
                                        experience, I am currently implementing
                                        another router simulator in ZPL.
                                        Finally, I am also doing a little bit
                                        of astronomy.
                                        This quarter, I am TAing CSE_451.
I enjoy watching movies, but mostly in
the comfort of my own home. I like to
eat (oh yeah, I've been a vegetarian
since my junior year in college) and
drink (dinner would not be the same
without a good wine.) As a result, I
must exercise quite a bit. I play on
two soccer teams: Cousin Scrubs (Co-Rec
division 9A) and Cooper's (Co-Rec
division 2A). Last season, the Scrubs   ****** MY OTHER LIFE ******
came in second place (9B) and Cooper's  [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/
won their division (4B). Unfortunately, sungeun/pictures/sungeun.other.gif]
I recently sacrified my left knee for
the game, and won't playing soccer or
taking my usual step aerobics class.
Instead, you may find me at the IMA
trying to swim and at a weight training
class. Like all good people in this
world, I try to read a few books, take
in a bit of Shakespeare, watch public
television, and listen to classical
music.
