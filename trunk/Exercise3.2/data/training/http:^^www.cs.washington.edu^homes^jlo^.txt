I'm currently working on architectural and compiler support for Simultaneous
Multithreading_(SMT). My research interests also include static and dynamic
scheduling for superscalar and VLIW processors, instruction-level parallelism
issues, as well as compilation for multithreaded architectures. In particular,
I am investigating compilation issues for
