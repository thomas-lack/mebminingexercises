Welcome to Markus' home page.

***** About myself *****
I moved from Karlsruhe, Germany to Seattle in fall 94. For those interested in
geography, Karlsruhe is located in the southwest of Germany, in the state of
Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. I grew up in another part of that state, in the district of
Biberach in Upper Swabia (Oberschwaben). Before coming to the UW I studied
Computer Science at the University_of_Karlsruhe from which I obtained a
"Diplom" (M.S.) in Computer Science in 1992. I also spent one year at UMass as
a Fulbright grantee. My main research interests are parallel and distributed
computing, object-oriented systems and compilers. Currently I am working on
dynamic_compilation.
Non-CS interests include Spanish and Latin_American_Culture, travel, e.g. to
[Peru] good books, e.g. The_Labyrinth_of_Solitude, chess non-mainstream movies,
eg Die_Angst_des_Torwarts_beim_Elfmeter (do you know Handke?) and salsa_or
merengue dancing with [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mock/heart.jpg] And,
if there's still time left, I check out what else to_do in Seattle.
More to come..

***** And a quote: *****
Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they
spin; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these.
Matthew 6:28
