***** Background *****
I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington in the Department_of
Computer_Science_and_Engineering. I grew up in Germany (near DÃ¼sseldorf), and
spent a few years in High School in Princeton, NJ. I received a B.A. in
Computer Science from Rutgers University in 1992 and spent several summers at
AT&T_Bell_Labs and the MITRE_Corporation working on a range of projects. I'm
the sole proprietor of MEF Systems, a company that I created in December 1993
to sell a distributed, fault tolerant, IP network based telephone system that I
built from scratch on a set of VME chasis with 680x0 processors, using UniVoice
telephone interface cards and the VxWorks operating system.
Most of my time I spend hacking on SPIN, which is a safe, adaptable and
extensible operating system. My primary contribution to SPIN is An_Extensible
Protocol_Architecture_for_Application-Specific_Networking. Applications achieve
compelling performance improvements using our new structure, when compared to
similar applications running on DEC's commercial OSF/1 V3.2 platform. For a

***** Recent reports and papers *****
  An_Extensible_Protocol_Architecture_for_Application-Specific_Networking
      A design and implementation and performance paper. Describes an
      extensible protocol architecture that allows anyone to customize an in-
      kernel protocol graph, which enables applications achieves better
      performance compared to similar applications running on conventional
      operating systems. For a demonstration of this work as it services HTTP
      requests contact http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu.
      Appeared in the Proceedings of the 1996_Winter_USENIX_Technical
      Conference
  Extensibility,_Safety_and_Performance_in_the_SPIN_Operating_System
      A design, implementation and performance paper.
      Appeared in the Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM Symposium on Operating
      Systems Principles.
  Language_Support_for_Extensible_Operating_Systems
      We've been pretty happy with M3, but we've had to deal with a few
      shortcomings in order to use the language in a safe extensible operating
      system. This paper describes how we've addressed those shortcomings.
  Safe_Dynamic_Linking_in_an_Extensible_Operating_System
      Describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel. Key
      point is the ability to create and manage linkable namespaces that
      describe interfaces and collections of interfaces.
  Protection_is_a_Software_Issue
      A position paper comparing software and hardware protection mechanisms.
      Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating
      Systems.
  Region_Analysis:_A_Parallel_Elimination_Method_for_Data_Flow_Analysis
      In IEEE 1995 Transactions on Software Engineering.
