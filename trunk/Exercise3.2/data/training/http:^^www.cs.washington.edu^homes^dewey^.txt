***** About me *****
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Washington. What do you need to know about me?
I like music and books. I love to play games, ride my bike, write letters, and
drink tea. My favorite color is blue, my favorite ocean is the Atlantic, and my
old roommate thinks I'm more like an owl than any other animal.

***** Northern Ireland *****
I returned from my trip to Belfast on June 8th, carrying sixty pages of notes
from interviews in my carry-on luggage. Now, I need to get those semi-chaotic
notes into a readable and hopefully enlightening format. As I work on this
draft, feel free to read over my shoulder; I will periodically make my drafts
available here in both html and PostScript formats. The goal is to encourage
frequent feedback as soon as possible. Please read and then mail_me. Please
note as well that I have not had much time to work on this project lately.
Hopefully, we'll see some progress near the end of the summer.

***** Go *****
I'm new to the game of Go, but I'm already addicted. If you're curious about
the game, check out these links:
    * For a fascinating, thorough history of the development of the game in
      China, read Go_in_Ancient_China.
    * The_Go_page_at_imageek.york.cuny.edu.
    * Ken's_Go_page provides many links to interesting Go sites.
    * Jansteen's_page is the most thorough I've seen.
