===============================================================================
I'm a third year graduate student in the Computer_Science_&_Engineering
Department at the University_of_Washington, working on my Ph.D.
===============================================================================
I'm interested both in Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, and Mathematics, and
I'm trying to combine aspects from all these disciplines in my research.
The professors in our department I work closest with are Tony_Derose (graphics)
[he's actually not here any more, but left UW for Pixar] and Linda_Shapiro
(vision). Additionally I work with Werner Stuetzle and John McDonald
(statistics), Tom Duchamp (mathematics), and Hugues Hoppe and Rick Szeliski
(Microsoft research).
I did my quals project TRIBORS: Triplet-Based Object Recognition System while
working as an RA for Linda, my report is a Technical Report 95-01-01 of the
Department of Computer Science & Engineering in the University of Washington.
Currently I'm working on surface reconstruction from range data. We have a
multiple-baseline camera system for obtaining data, we use subdivision surfaces
and wavelet analysis for surface geometry and reflectance functions.
I just passed my General Examination, where the topic was Rigid Registration of
3D data. Click here to find out more about it.
===============================================================================
**** Some class projects from my 2nd year at UW ****
CSE_548, Computer Architecture Systems, the class was taught by Susan_Eggers.
CSE_552, Distributed Computing, the class was taught by Brian_Bershad.
CSE_576, Image Understanding, the class was taught by Steven_Tanimoto.
===============================================================================
I presented two Technical Sketches in SIGGRAPH '96. You can get to my slides on
subdivision_surfaces and to my slides on removing_wavelets .
