Welcome to my page! I'm a grad student / research nerd in artificial
intelligence here at the University_of_Wisconsin-Madison. I grew up in Grand
Rapids,_Michigan, (which is the Late_Show's ex-Home_Office), earned a degree in
math_at_Michigan_State, and a master's in computer_science_here_at_the_UW. I'm
now a dissertator at this institution, after taking a little over a year to
develop traffic measurements software for AT&amp;T after my first thesis
advisor left Wisconsin. When I'm not at my trusty NeXTstation or the library, I
enjoy playing trumpet and piano, listening to "longhair_music", playing
volleyball with the InterVarsity folks, and contributing to the SuperSoaker
arms race.
If you have any comments about my pages, feel free to use my comment_form, or
just send_me_e-mail. Or finger_my_account to see my current plan and whether
I'm on the system.
***** Gainful employment: *****
I am a TA for CS_540, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
***** Current Project: *****
If computers are so smart, why do we have to understand them? Making machines
more intelligent is the goal of Artificial Intelligence. To me, the essence of
intelligence is the ability to learn and adapt, to learn to act appropriately
in order to reach our goals. Reinforcement learning treats this problem in the
general case where the system has outputs to control actions that can change
its environment, and it has inputs through which it senses its environment. It
also has an input for reinforcement, which is a weak kind of feedback which can
be expressed as a positive or negative number. So, instead of having a teacher
to present the system with input/output pairs, the system instead receives
"thumbs up" or "thumbs down" at irregular intervals.
My work has focussed on how the need to distinguish good actions from bad ones
can direct the process of building a good representation of the environment in
terms of relevant, or important features. (See my note on importance-based
feature_extraction). Currently I am applying this notion of importance to the
problem of learning to balance the need to explore the world with the need to
perform optimally (exploration vs. exploitation). I am also investigating ways
of using importance to make the learning process more efficient by allowing the
system to specify the starting points for its learning experiments (active
learning). My goal is to develop a better understanding of intelligent
adaptation. I hope that this will provide a basis for intelligent action which
will also benefit from knowledge-based and task-based work. See my (really out-
of-date, sorry!) reinforcement_learning_page for more information.
***** My Hotlist *****
This is my_browser-independent_hotlist. I keep a copy here so I can access it
from any of the browser/platform combinations I use. It's actually my Bookmarks
file from OmniWeb, which is a more_elegant_and_more_functional_browser_than
Netscape, in my opinion. OmniWeb is currently only available for NEXTSTEP, but
will be available for all the OpenStep variants when OpenStep is released.
