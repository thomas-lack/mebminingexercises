I am the Internet Tools Specialist for InterNIC Net Scout. What this means is
that I read everything about Internet technology, try to make sense of it and
then write overview articles for the Net Scout Toolkit. The great thing is that
I read everything and think about it anyway, so it was rather foolish for them
to pay me to do this (But don't tell them!).
Eric_Hazen and I also provide most of the technical and Webmaster services for
the Net Scout group, although we do get a lot of excellent help from the
Computer_Systems_Lab (CSL) and the folks at InterNIC.
Before recently joining the Net Scout Team, I worked at the Laboratory_of
Molecular_Biology and the Integrated_Microscopy_Resource_(IMR), an NIH
Biomedical Resource for nearly eight years. At Molecular Biology I was
fortunate to co-develop with Prof. Sean_Carroll and his lab a technique for
creating multiple label confocal images. Basically these are cool looking
images of developing embryos that get on a lot of journal and book covers. I
also developed the Molecular Biology Web site.
At the IMR, I was fortunate to work with Prof. John_White and the rest of the
IMR_staff. While at the IMR, I developed their Web site which received 4-stars
in the Magellan Internet Guide. My last major project involved the co-
development of a 4 Dimensional Microscope for studying how embryos develop.
This microscope is described in an article which appeared in the August_2nd
1996_issue_of_the_Journal_Science.
Here are some photos of guests of Net Scout Labs.
