===============================================================================
I am a PhD student in Computer Science and my areas of interest are Distributed
Systems and Multimedia Systems. I did my Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems
Engineering from N.E.D. University of Engineering and Technology in Karachi,
Pakistan. Since then, which was in 1992, I had been working in AT&T Global
Information Solutions as a Systems Engineer. At present, I am on a study leave
for my master's program here at Cornell.
My job responsibilities with AT&T included:
