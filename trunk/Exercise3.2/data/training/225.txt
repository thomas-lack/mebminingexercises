***** Why am I not in China? *****
While I was a Graduate Student in Tsinghua_Univ . I decided it is time for a
change of p(l)ace. What better place to go, I thought, than Texas! So, I ended
up at the beautiful University_of_Texas_at_Austin, where I am currently working
on a Ph.D. in Computer Science!

     sea of information, if one searches like a miner searching for
     diamonds among millions of rocks."
