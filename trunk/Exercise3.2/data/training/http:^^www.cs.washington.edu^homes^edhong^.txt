Did you know that I'm a second year graduate computer science student at the
University of Washington? Well I am. And that's all I have to say about that.
For those business type people with little time on their hands, I had to
include my resume link at the top, in postcript and in plain text form.
My office: room 233 Seig Hall; (206)543-7798.
My current home: (206) 244-1261
Currently, I'm working with Anna Karlin and Craig Chambers on a theoretical
model for dynamic compilation. More specifically, I'm working on developing an
on-line algorithm that will work well for dynamic compilation. I plan this to
be my quals project.

My Sister wanted a home page, so I helped her create one. I also have a list of
various people that I know, on another_web_page.
One of my interests includes keeping up on the computer industry. These sites
give insightful commentary on what's happening. If you know of any other such
places, please mail me.

I own a Power Macintosh, so I guess that makes me biased towards liking macs.
However, I think better computers that are even easier to use have yet to
come....
