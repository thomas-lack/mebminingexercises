  Title:
      Structure from Motion: the Inverse Projection Problem
                 [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/pictures/salt.gif]
  Abstract:
      An important problem in computer vision is recovering the 3-D structure
      of a scene and the position of the observer within it from one or more
      projected 2-D images. This is essentially the inverse projection problem.
      Existing Structure-From-Motion (SFM) techniques solve this problem by
      examining multiple images projected from a rigid scene. However SFM has
      not been used extensively in practice because these techniques are very
      sensitive to noise, do not accurately model optical projection, or
      restrict the position of the observer and/or the structure of the scene.
      My research uses a new technique for solving the inverse projection
      problem called the Concurrent Projector Model which makes no assumptions
      about the scene other than it is rigid and no assumptions about the
      position of the observer. This technique uses a projector based model of
      projection instead of the camera based model traditionally used in SFM.
      As a result, the algorithm is defined for any geometric transformation in
      any dimension, not just 3-D perspective projection. For a given
      transformation and dimension the algorithm identifies when the inverse
      projection problem is under-constrained and specifies the minimum number
      of points and images required to solve it. The Concurrent Projector Model
      can also examine additional points and images to minimize the types of
      projection errors that occur in real-world applications by allowing the
      projectors to approximately intersect.
      This technique is currently being applied to the problem of robot
      navigation and exploration to both determine the position of a robot in
      an unknown environment and at the same time to map this environment.

***** Teaching Duties for Spring 1995-96 *****
  CS_110_Introduction_to_Computer_Programming:
      Sections 1 and 2 (FORTRAN)
      CS 110 is a one-credit course which covers the basic programming
      structures needed to prepare students for CS 310 and elementary
      engineering courses. No prior computer programming experience is required
      and only a basic knowledge of computers is assumed. The material covered
      enables students to write simple computer programs to solve engineering
      problems in elementary courses. All programming is done in FORTRAN. This
      course is intended for students who received little or no programming
      instruction in high school.
      These sections are taught entirely in the FORTRAN programming language
      and are intended primarily for engineering students and non-computer
      science majors.

  CS_302_Algebraic_Language_Programming:
      Section 70 (FORTRAN)
      Construction of algorithms; problem solving; instruction and experience
      in the use of at least one procedure-oriented language (e.g., Pascal or
      Fortran); survey of other such languages, advanced programming
      techniques. Prereq: Advanced high school mathematical preparation or some
      college work in mathematics, statistics or logic; or consent of
      instructor. Open to Fr.
      This section is taught entirely in the FORTRAN programming language and
      is intended primarily for engineering students and non-computer science
      majors.
