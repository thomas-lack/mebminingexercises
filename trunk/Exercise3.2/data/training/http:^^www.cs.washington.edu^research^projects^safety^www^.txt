               [Software Safety at the University of Washington]
===============================================================================
Software is playing an increasingly important role in systems such as nuclear
reactors, aircraft, defence and space systems, chemical plants, and medical
equipment. Because of the consequences of a malfunction, these safety-critical
systems must pass rigorous tests and reviews before they may be used. Although
system safety engineering techniques have existed for decades, most do not
apply to systems that contain digital computers and software.
The goal of the University of Washington Safety Project is to develop a
theoretical foundation for safety and a methodology for building safety-
critical systems built upon that foundation. In Safeware:_System_Safety_and
Computers, Nancy Leveson summarizes the issues involved and lays the foundation
for the methodology. We are now working on safety analysis techniques to
support the methodology and a set of prototype tools to be used to validate the
specification and analysis techniques.
