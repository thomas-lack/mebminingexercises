[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/c.gif] all me Steven. Some years
ago, nevermind how long exactly, I arrived as a second son to a set of proud
parents. If this sounds like Moby Dick to you, then let me assure you, I have
no intention of finding a ship to hunt a whale. But I digress. Brought up in
Taiwan until the tender age of seven, my whole family migrated south to the
tropical islands of the Philippines. There we made our home, and lived some
fifteen years. Here's a picture of Mom and me when I was around six years old.
[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/i.gif] thus became quite fluently
bilingual. As I love to read, the poetry of the Tang Dynasty, the Arabian
Nights - quite naturally, the children's version, and a host of other stories
somewhat fulfilled the Wen in my name which means 'Literature'.
[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/a.gif] class in grade seven was
to set the course of my life. I dove right into the marvel that was a computer.
Four years later, I entered the University_of_the_Philippines with that as my
major, and very likely my career.
[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/i.gif] had found talent in me
that draws me to the art and science of computing, and unabashedly, knew I was
quite good at it. Was also in College when I met her - and I she met. In a
whirlwind of happiness and peace three years and running, a woman has become
the most important part of my life, effortlessly defeating my hobbies of old
with her love.
[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/s.gif] eeking a career more
ideal, and higher paying to be blunt, I enrolled in the Cornell University
graduate program. Thus far, I have been rewarded with almost everything I have
ever wanted and worked for. I am a lucky man."

Welcome to my home page. To segregate myself from your everyday geek, I'd like
to think I'm a man of many interests. Aside from actually writing a C program,
here's what I'd happily do in my spare time:
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Read anything
      from Calvin and Hobbes to Unix Network Programming;
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Internet Relay
      Chat - I can generally be found as steven on LinuxNet;
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Building Lego®
      things (Of course I'm just practicing object-oriented design!); [http://
      www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/falcon.gif]
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Building plastic
      models of weapons of war;
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Watching
      suspense-thriller films;
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Listening to the
      music of Sting, U2, and many others;
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Watch Sesame
      Street® or the Discovery Channel; and
      [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/ball.gif] Railroad models,
      when I get rich enough.
In the field of computers, I also have a rather broad spectrum of interests,
though my studies have concentrated in the areas of computer graphics and
networking. If you wish to be offended by some blatant self-promotion, you may
want to check out my resumé. I'm also highly interested in Linux, a freely-
available operating system for the Intel 80386 or compatible computer.
My Master of Engineering project is a 3-D_Modeler_for_Blobby_Models_or
Metaballs under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Land. I am currently involved in
another course project involving a survey_of_techniques_in_modeling_human_faces
and a resolution-independent and portable audio_effects_editor.
