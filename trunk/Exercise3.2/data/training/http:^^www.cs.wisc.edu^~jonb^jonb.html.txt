                   ****** Welcome to Jon's Home Page! ******
I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
studying computer science. I am a TA for CS_132:_Using_Computers. I am also
maintaining a FAQ_(Frequently_Asked_Questions)_List on the latest PowerBook
models released by Apple (the 5300's, the 190's, and the 2300's)

**** Here are a few things to look at: ****
  Students_in_my_CS_132_Lab_Sections_should_click_here
  I've_amassed_a_big_list_of_good_Web_sites,_in_a_number_of_catagories.
  Check out the Web pages for the UW-Madison_CS_department, UW-Madison_itself,
  and my alma mater, RPI!
  The sites I visit the most often are:
    Apple's_Home_Page -- For all your Mac needs
    The_Nando_Times -- For great news coverage
    The_Spot -- For mind-numbing, soap-operaish drivel
    ZiffNet -- For computer industry news
    CS564:_Database_Management_Systems and CS_701:_Construction_of_Compilers -
    - For keeping up with my classwork
    Today's_Dilbert -- For a bit of a chuckle
