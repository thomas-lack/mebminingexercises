****** Tracy Kimbrel is being held prisoner!
 ******
Tracy Kimbrel has been held prisoner at the University of Washington since 1982
without charge or trial. He was moved for six years to another Seattle area
prison, where most of the inmates are forced to manufacture airplanes. He
escaped that institution, but was recaptured and returned to the University of
Washington. Help end his plight! Rescue him from his imprisonment. Here is a
list of things he has done (curriculum_vitae) while imprisoned. Here are some
more details and a statement of what he promises to do for you (history_and
goals) if you free him from his captors.
