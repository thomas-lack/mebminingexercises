I am a graduate student at Cornell in the Computer_Science_Department, under
the supervision of Robert_Constable. Here's a summary of my current status:

===============================================================================
My interests include the theory and practice of programming languages. There is
a great resource at CMU under The_Fox_Project_Home_Page, especially Mark
Leone's_resources_for_programming_language_research.
My own work in programming languages is mainly software verification. One of
the tools I use for specification is type theory. I use the formal system
Nuprl, developed here at the_Cornell_University_Department_of_Computer_Science.
In my research I make use of higher-level modules and abstract data types, and
relate them to type-theory.
Here are some recent papers:
    * Some_papers_I_have_published_at_Cornell
    * A_bibliography_of_some_papers_I_published_at_Bellcore
I also have some slides of talks I have given in the Nuprl seminar. The slides
can be pretty technical, but they give an overview of the work I've done at
Cornell.

Some interests I have include:
    * The Fine Arts. Here is a gallery of mine. There are a lot of other
      resources for fine arts on the Web. Try The_Art_Net_Web, or The_FineArt
      Forum.
    * CUCS_Hockey
    * Backcountry. Take a look at The_Backcountry_Home_Page.
I perform a few services for the department:
    * Publicly-maintained_Software_Czar;
    * Hockey and hockey-equipment czar. Go back to Hockey for more info.
    * Theatre czar. Here is the schedule_for_the_Cornell_Center_for_the_Theatre
      Arts.
