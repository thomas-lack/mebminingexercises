**** Research ****
Broadly speaking, my primary research interests are in type theory and the
design, implementation and semantics of programming languages. My recent
emphasis has been in the areas of subtyping, object-oriented programming and
modularity. I am implementing a practical programming language KML which
combines these features in a functional programming language, and formulating
for it a type-theoretic semantics.
An interesting view of programming languages is as a tractable approximation to
the intractably rich world of foundational type theories, in which the whole of
mathematics can be performed. New programming language developments often
result from mapping type-theoretic constructions through an approximation into
a programming language setting, and, conversely, new paradigms in programming
languages are often not well understood until they have been formulated type-
theoretically. I am interested in deepening our understanding of this
relationship between type theory and programming languages, particularly the
issues of tractability and approximation and how they can be mitigated.
I am also interested in a model of compilation that views it as a series of
translations into "lower" intermediate calculi, where each intermediate
calculus can be embedded into type theory and the corresponding interpretation
of a program is invariant under each translation. Such a model allows us to
relate each stage of compilation to an original type-theoretic semantics, which
allows the use of standard compilation techniques and optimizations while
guaranteeing safety and correctness. Also, careful formulation of such
intermediate calculi make possible additional optimizations that are
unavailable in other compilation strategies.
My work forms part of the Nuprl project here at Cornell. The project name comes
from the Nuprl system of formal mathematics and logic, a type theory based on
the type theories of Martin-LÃ¶f that is also implemented in an automated
reasoning system.
My committee consists of Robert_Constable, Greg_Morrisett, and Dexter_Kozen. I
also work closely with Jason_Hickey.

     "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
     "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel,
     the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all
     your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all
     your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'
     There is no commandment greater than these."
     -- Mark 12:29-31
