Jean-Loup Baer, Professor and Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering,
received the Diplome d'Ingénieur in Electrical Enginering and the Doctorat 3e
cycle in Computer Science from the Université de Grenoble (France) and the
Ph.D. from UCLA in 1968.
Prior to joining the University of Washington in 1969, he was a Research
Engineer with the Laboratoire de Calcul, Université de Grenoble, and a member
of the Digital Technology Group at UCLA (1966-69). His present interests are in
parallel and distributed processing and computer systems architecture. He is
author or coauthor of more than 60 papers in these areas and the author of the
textbook ``Computer Systems Architecture'' (Computer Science Press, 1980).
Professor Baer has served as an IEEE Computer Science Distinguished Visitor,
and was an ACM National Lecturer. He is a Guggenheim Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, an
editor of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, and of the Journal
of Computer Languages. He has served as Program Chairman for the 1977
International Conference on Parallel Processing, as co-Program Chairman for the
10th International Symposium on Computer Architecture, and as General co-
Chairman of the 17th International Symposium on Computer Architecture. He is
currently Chair of ACM SIGARCH. Eighteen Ph.D. students have completed their
dissertation under Professor Baer's direction. Twelve of them work in industry
or research laboratories and six are in academia.
Although he has been in the U.S.A. for over 30 years, Dr. Baer has had no
difficulty in retaining his French accent.

**** Recent research projects ****
    * Look under the Computer_architecture page. Projects in which I am/was
      involved are:
          o Cache coherence protocols for cluster_architectures and improved
            protocols for single_bus systems.
          o Use and performance of software_primitives for clusters (to appear
            in HPCA-3)
          o Prefetching in uniprocessors, via hardware (see also IEEE TC May
            95)and comparison with non-blocking_caches (see also ASPLOS-V);
            prefetching in multiprocessors (cf. ISCA 94)
          o Impact of speculative execution on I-caches , see Dennis_Lee home
            page and ISCA 95.
          o Parallel trace-driven simulations: conservative_approach (see also
            ICPP 95); optimistic_approach and their comparison (see also
            Distributed Simulation 95)
