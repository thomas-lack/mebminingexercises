***** [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/basu/icons/atwork.gif] What
Anindya is doing here *****
I am a graduate student in Computer_Science at Cornell University hoping to
complete a PhD by the turn of the century. When I am not listening to rock
music or goofing off, I work on the Cornell_ATM_Cluster_Project with my advisor
Thorsten_von_Eicken. [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/basu/icons/

***** [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/basu/icons/devil.gif] What Anindya
thinks is cool *****
Like most other graduate students from India who went to the Indian_Institute
of_Technology,_Kanpur, I am a die hard Pink_Floyd fanatic and finally realized
my childhood dream of seeing them perform live last summer in Philadelphia. The
other "P" I am in love with is Plum who is known to the great unwashed as
Pelham Grenville Wodehouse. And yes, I also attended Woodstock_'94! For the
truly motivated, here is an online Woodstock_review with photographs. Woodstock
is where I experienced Metallica live for the first time! I would have loved to
see the soccer_worldcup last year, but unfortunately, it did not happen. I like
to cook, and have tried to put some recipes that I like online. I also fancy
myself as a connoisseur of good whisky, especially single_malts.

***** And now for something completely different.. *****
I am working on the Cornell_ATM_Cluster_Project which aims at providing a high
performance communications layer on clusters of workstations such that parallel
program performance comparable to state of the art MPPs can be acheived on such
clusters. We have developed a very fast message passing layer called U-Net and
an implementation of Active Messages and Split-C on U-Net that show performance
at par with parallel programs running on the CM-5 and the Meiko CS-2. In
addition TCP/UDP implemented on U-Net shows really low latencies and can
saturate the fibre at low segment sizes. We are also working in collaboration
with the Berkeley NoW_project team to develop a specification for a
communications layer that would enable fast communication between processes
both in trusted and untrusted environments.
