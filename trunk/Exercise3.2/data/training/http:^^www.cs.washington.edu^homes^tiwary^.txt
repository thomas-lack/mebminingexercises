===============================================================================
I am a mostly-full-time fourth year graduate student. I work in the area of
Single Address Space Operating Systems (Opal), Persistent Object Systems,
Object Oriented Databases, Application Workload Measurement and Operating
System Support for Databases. In the past, I have worked with CAD
infrastructures, User Interfaces and Distributed Object Systems. In my spare
time, I work in the Computer Science group at the Research and Technology
Organization of Boeing_Computer_Services.

**** Opal ****
I am working on distribution in Opal. Opal is an operating systems project
which addresses the issues and opportunities involved with creating a single,
global address space, across multiple users and machines. Jeff_Chase is the
primary architect of Opal. Hank_Levy is the advisor working most closely with
Opal and is also my advisor.
**** Application Workload Measurement ****
I am also work on measuring and characterizing the behavior of persistent
object applications and some general techniques for doing this. See the paper
below for some of my work in this area.
**** Distributed Object Systems ****
I have worked on several distributed object systems in my professional career.
This experience was the basis of OOPSLA95_Workshop_on_Building_Large
Distributed_Software_Systems_Using_Objects that I co-organized. In 1996, we
will follow this up by OOPSLA96_Workshop_on_Objects_in_Large_Distrbuted_and
Persistent_Software_Systems.
