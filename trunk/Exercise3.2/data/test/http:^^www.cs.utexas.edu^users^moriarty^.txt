Sequential decision tasks appear in many practical real-world problems
including control, resource allocation, and routing. Such tasks can be
characterized by the following scenario: An agent observes a state of a dynamic
system and selects from a finite set of actions. The system then enters a new
state upon which the agent must select another action. The system may return a
payoff for each decision made or for a sequence of decisions. The objective is
to select the sequence of actions that return the highest total or cumulative
payoff. In my research, I evolve Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms to
learn and perform sequential decision tasks. I am particularly interested in
tasks where problem-specific knowledge is currently unavailable or costly to
obtain. Some domains that I have studied include game playing, intelligent
control, and constraint satisfaction. For more information, see my list_of
publications.
