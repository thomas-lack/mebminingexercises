***** Research Info *****
My research interest is primarly graphical user_interfaces, although I am a
self-proclaimed graphics groupie. I'm I'm currently working with Steve_Tanimoto
on the Mathematics_Experiences_Through_Image_Processing_(METIP) project. The
goal of this project is interest junior high school kids in mathematics using
exploratory rather than rote learning methods. In particular, I'm interested in
developing Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning_(CSCL) user interfaces
that can be used in this, as well as other, projects.
