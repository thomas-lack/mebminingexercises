Henry M. Levy, Professor, joined the faculty in 1983. Hank's current research
projects focus on operating systems, on parallel and distributed_computing, on
computer architecture (particularly "Simultaneous_Multithreading"
architectures) and on object-based languages and environments. A recent project
called Opal deals with single-address space operating systems for 64-bit
computer architectures. The Etch project is producing a tool for performance
instrumentation and optimization of x86 binary executables.
Levy is author of two books and numerous papers on computer systems, including
``outstanding paper''selections from four consecutive ACM Symposia on Operating
Systems Principles. He is former chair of ACM_SIGOPS (the Special Interest
Group on Operating Systems), and program chair for the 16th_ACM_Symposium_on
Operating_Systems_Principles, to be held in 1997. He holds a B.S. from
Carnegie-Mellon University and an M.S. from the University of Washington.
Before coming to Washington, he was a Consulting Engineer with Digital
Equipment Corporation, where his work spanned the range from operating systems
to architectures for distributed systems and workstations. Hank is a Fellow of
the Association_for_Computing_Machinery and recipient of a Fulbright Research
Scholar Award.
Eleven Master's students and nine Ph.D. students have survived Levy's
supervision; the Ph.D. students have all escaped to academic positions or major
research labs. When not glued to his workstation, Hank can usually be found
skiing, biking, playing tennis, helping to lead the department's infamous
softball team (the Smiling_Potatoes_of_Death), or sampling desserts at one of
Seattle's many dessert parlors.
