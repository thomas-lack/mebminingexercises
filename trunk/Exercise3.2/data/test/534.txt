I have developed system software for the Systolic Cellular Array Machine
(SCAM), a massively parallel image processing computer. The software includes a
compiler, basic image processing and morphology libraries, and a simulator. You
can obtain the software and papers about SCAM here.

I currently work on document layout extraction at the Intelligent_Systems_Lab.
I am also helping to produce a document groundtruth database for the optical
character recognition community.
