**** Standard disclaimer ****
Naturally, nothing on my web pages should be taken as representing the official
position of the University of Texas at Austin or any other part of the
government of the State of Texas. (Furthermore, to steal a joke from Peter
Deutsch, my having a web page on a government-owned computer should not be
taken as an indication that I endorse everything that the government does.)
**** Formal methods have always been risky to use ****
``Peano was one of the first to use what we now call symbolic logic. He
introduced, for instance, the use of the symbols `(E x)' to mean `there is an x
such that'; and he habitually wrote out all of his lecture notes in his new
symbolism. He was teaching at a military academy at the time, and his students
were so incensed by his formalistic approach to mathematics that they rebelled
(despite his promises to pass them all) and got him fired. Subsequently he
found a more congenial setting at the University of Turin.'' -- GÃ¶del's
Incompleteness Theorems, Rudy Rucker, p. 289.
**** The Death of Fundamental Science? ****
"`Fundamental science is on the verge of extinction.' said Harold W. Kroto of
Britain's Sussex University, who shared the 1996 chemistry prize with Robert F.
Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston, for their discovery
of carbon atoms bound in the shape of a soccer ball." -- From the article
"Scientists lament loss of funding," Associated Press, December 10, 1996, Daily
Texan.
