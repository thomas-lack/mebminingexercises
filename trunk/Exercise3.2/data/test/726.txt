***** Research Summary *****
Optimization theory is rich mathematically while being very effective
computationally in solving many real-life problems. My interests in this topic
have ranged over a broad spectrum that encompasses theoretical aspects, such as
error bounds for mathematical programs and variational inequalities,
convergence proofs for parallel gradient and variable distribution algorithms
for optimization, smoothing techniques for solving constrained optimization
problems as differentiable nonlinear equations, as well as applications to
machine learning, both in general and specific contexts. An important aspect of
my research is the use of mathematical programming techniques in diagnosing
breast cancer, that has resulted in a highly accurate computerized diagnostic
system in current use at University of Wisconsin Hospitals.
