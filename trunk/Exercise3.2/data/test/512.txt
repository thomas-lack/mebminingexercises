***** About me *****
I'm a second-year student doing my MSc in www.washington.edu">University of
Washington
. Before this, I was an undergrad at the University_of_Pennsylvania. I've been
a TA for CSE 471, CSE 142 and CSE 143.
===============================================================================
***** Research Interests *****
I am interested in image retrieval, where the problem is trying to find images
in a huge database of images. Virage and QBIC are two commercial examples
similar to the kind of stuff I'm working on. Here are some snapshots of what
I've done.

***** Singapore *****
Singapore_InfoMap provides facts and statistics about Singapore.
Try the Singapore_OnLine_Guide if you plan to take a trip there.
The National_Computer_Board is in charge of transforming Singapore into an
intelligent island. This is where I'll work when I graduate.
The_Straits_Times is Singapore's main English newspaper.
