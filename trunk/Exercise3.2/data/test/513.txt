****** Michael Ernst ******
I am a graduate student in the University_of_Washington computer_science
department. Previously, I have been a lecturer in the Rice_University computer
science_department, a researcher in the Program_Analysis_Group at Microsoft
Research, and a graduate student at the MIT Laboratory_for_Computer_Science in
the MIT_EECS_Department. These WWW pages are not frequently updated.
My technical interests include:
    * compilation: static analysis, slicing, debugging optimized code,
      serialization of parallel programs; I was program chair for IR_'95, the
      intermediate representation workshop colocated with POPL_'95
    * intellectual_property, particularly in computer programs
    * other areas including game theory, cryptography, philosophy, and
      denotational semantics
I maintain a list of resources_for_conference_and_workshop_organizers.
Occasionally I manage to slip away from work and carry on a real_life. Here are
some links_of_possible_interest_(including_pages_I_maintain).
