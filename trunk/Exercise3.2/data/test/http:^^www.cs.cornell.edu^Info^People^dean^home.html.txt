I currently serve both as a researcher and an administrator in the Computer
Science Department at Cornell. In my guise as an administrator, I manage the
Computer Facilities Support group and worry about a number of issues including
computer security, networking, and building web services.
On the research side, I am the principal investigator for Cornell's part of the
CS-TR_project. This is an ARPA-funded consortium of the top five computer
science departments and the Corporation_for_National_Research_Initiatives_
(CNRI). Our research is intended to further the rapid dissemination of breaking
technical research over the Internet, as well as making available on-line the
existing libraries of technical reports from the consortium members.
As part of the CS-TR project, two researchers working at Cornell, Jim_Davis, a
Xerox employee of the Design_Research_Institute_(DRI), and Carl Lagoze,
employed by the CS-TR project, have developed and implemented a protocol and
system for the dissemination over the net of technical reports and similar
material. The system, called Dienst, is now in use at eight University sites on
the net. A technical_report on Dienst is available. For more information on
Dienst and the CS-TR project, please send email to cs-tr@cs.cornell.edu.
I've put together a_page_of_selected_URLs, some related to my research, some to
the computing facilities, and some are just things I'm interested in.
