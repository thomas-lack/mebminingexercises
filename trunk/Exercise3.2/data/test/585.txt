===============================================================================
A major educational problem in United States and some other countries is that
students in grades K-12 lose interest in mathematics and science as they
progress through school. Students often complain that mathematics is difficult
and that they don't see much use for it past simple arithmetic. In response to
these concerns, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has identified
a number of features that the grades 5-8 curriculum should include in order to
help motivate students to stay interested:
    * favor conceptual learning over rote operations;
    * emphasize practical uses of mathematics;
    * encourage discussions and group learning; and
    * encourage exploratory, open-ended learning.
The goal of the METIP project is to use digital_image_processing to help meet
these objectives. In particular, we have developed a series of applications
designed to allow students to manipulate digitized images of their choice.
These materials are intended to be used in enrichment activities rather than
part of a standard classroom curriculum. Teachers can play various roles with
these activities; for example, they can catalyze student learning by leading
discussions of the concepts students have explored on the computer.
The METIP Project currently has a number of programs that allow students to
explore mathematics with image processing:
    * The_Pixel_Calculator (Click here to order your free copy today!)
    * The_Image_Warper (Click here to order your free copy today!)
    * The_Transform_Programmer (Click here to order your free copy today!)
These applications were developed primarily for 386/486/Pentium based PC's
running Microsoft Windows. One application, the Pixel Calculator, is also
available for the Apple Macintosh.

Here is a list of all the people working on the METIP project.
A closely related project we are involved with is the study of multiplayer
educational_activities. The METIP project is working to integrate the use of
the WWW into its activities. Some ideas are described in Prospects_for_the
Direct_Use_of_Distributed_Image_Databases_in_Educational_Image_Processing.
Currently the project is collecting the experiences of users with its XFORM
image transformation software. If you have done something fun or useful with
the software please let us know. We are putting the current version of its
documentation online. Here_is_a_link_to_it.. A set of little demonstrations for
XFORM has been put together by graduate students who took a seminar_during_the
winter_of_1996..
The XFORM programming environment, integrated with a subset of Common Lisp,
offers the technical essentials for a new approach to learning and teaching
computer programming --- the fundamental attraction of using this approach is
that students learn to program the computer in the pursuit of creating neat
visual effects with digital images portraying people or things of interest to
them. If you have successfully installed the software and would like to discuss
teaching programming this way, please contact us.

METIP is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant
number MDR-9155709.
