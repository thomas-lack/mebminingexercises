***** Research: *****
My main interests are in Distributed Systems, Object-Oriented Languages and
Software Engineering.
Currently, I am working on Global Memoy Management in a workstation cluster
with

    * Mike_Feeley
    * Geoff_Voelker
New high-speed networks greatly encourage the use of network memory as a cache
for virtual memory and file pages, thereby reducing the need for disk access.
Network nodes with memory-intensive applications can use the primary memory of
lightly-loaded nodes as temporary backing store. This introduce a new level of
the memory hierarchy: namely, a global memory cache that lies (logically)
between local memory and disk.
Because pages are the fundamental transfer and access units in remote memory
systems, page size is a key performance factor. Recently, page sizes of modern
processors have been increasing in order to provide more TLB coverage and
amortize disk access costs. Unfortunately, for high-speed networks, small
transfers are needed to provide low latency. This trend in page size is thus at
odds with the use of network memory on high-speed networks. We studied the use
of subpages as a means of reducing transfer size and latency in a remote-memory
environment.

I did my thesis research on Debugging in an Distributed Object-Oriented System
in 1993 at the Universite_Joseph_Fourier, Grenoble. I was involved in the GUIDE
project at the Laboratoire_Bull-IMAG , part of the IMAG institut.

***** Fun: *****
    * There is a way to go to the ExTremE People Â® area. It's Not_here.
    * Visit the Louvre gallery [[Louvre]]
    * Look at the maps of France, Europe and World .
    * Some family_pictures.
    * Some friends_pictures.
