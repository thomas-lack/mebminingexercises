I'm a graduate student in the Department_of_Computer_Science at the University
of_Wisconsin,_Madison. I come from India, and had my undergraduate education at
the Indian_Institute_of_Technology,_Delhi. The Department_of_CS_at_IITD is a
fantastic place and worth visiting.
If you'd like to contact me, you can finger_me to find my whereabouts.
