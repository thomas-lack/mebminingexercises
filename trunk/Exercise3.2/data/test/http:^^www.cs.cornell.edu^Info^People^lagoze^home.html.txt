I lead the Digital_Library_Research_Group in the Computer_Science_Department at
Cornell_University. Our group manages the operation and technical development
of the Networked_Computer_Science_Technical_Reports_Library (NCSTRL). This is
an international consortium that maintains a distributed digital library of
computer science research and collaborates on a number of digital library
research issues.
I am co-developer, with Jim_Davis, of the Dienst software, a protocol and
reference implementation that provides distributed digital library servers
accessible over the World Wide Web. Dienst is the current enabling technology
for NCSTRL. I have authored or co-authored a number of papers on Dienst:
    * &quot;Drop-in&quot;_publishing_with_the_World_Wide_Web. 2nd Int'l WWW
      Conference 1994.
    * Dienst_-_An_Architecture_for_Distributed_Document_Libraries.
      Communications of the ACM, April 1995, Vol 38 No 4 page 47.
    * A_protocol_and_server_for_a_distributed_technical_report_library. Cornell
      Computer Science Technical Report.
    * Dienst:_implementation_reference_manual. Cornell Computer Science
      Technical Report.
    * Dienst:_Building_a_Production_Technical_Report_Server. Chapter 15 in
      Advances in Digital Libraries, Springer Verlag 1995.
My primary research involves defining the services and protocols for an
interoperable digital library infrastructure. In this area, I have collaborated
with the Corporation_for_National_Research_Initiatives to extend and implement
a digital_object_frameworkdeveloped as part of the DARPA-funded Computer
Science_Technical_Report_Project. I have authored or co-authored a number of
papers in this area:
    * Implementation_Issues_in_an_Open_Architectural_Framework_for_Digital
      Object_Services. Cornell Computer Science Technical Report.
    * A_Design_for_Interoperable_Secure_Object_Stores_(ISOS). Cornell Computer
      Science Technical Report.
    * A_Secure_Repository_Design_for_Digital_Libraries. Dlib Magazine,
      December, 1995.
As part of this work, I am also a member of the Dlib working group on
repository_interfaces and co-author of the yet-to-be-released final report of
the Metadata_Workshop_II in Warwick, U.K. Finally, and also as part of this
work, I am very interested in extending the World Wide Web using distributed
object technology. You can read my position_paper for the Joint_W3C/OMG
Workshop_on_Distributed_Objects_and_Mobile_Code workshop.
===============================================================================
There is more to me than this research. Who knows, you may meet me at a
conference, workshop, or meeting and find that out. As a poor substitute for
personal contact, let me say a little more about me.
That character on my lap in the picture at the top of this page is Lucy, my
daughter. She rules the majority of my life, outside of my work time. Toddlers
are a constant challenge and joy. Lucy gives meaning to my life that will never
be provided by my work.
I am also an avid outdoor person. Put me in site of fast moving water or a
quiet lakeand I will itch to get out on it in a canoe. Give me a beautiful day
and I will think only about bike riding along a quiet road or a backwoods
trail. Tell me I have a spare hour in my day and I will put on my running shoes
and breath deeply the fresh air. I may spend much of my time in the digital
world, but it will never be a substitute for the joys of the physical nor
should it ever interfere with our desire to fight for its preservation.
Hope to meet you sometime,
Carl
