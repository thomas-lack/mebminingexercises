*** Why this page is no longer black ***
In honor of the recent (June 12) decision in ACLU v. Reno, this page is no
longer black. Mind you, the decision is merely an interim step (you could read
my take on it), so I'm probably still committing a felony. (And so should we
all, if we care about speech and freedom and the marketplace of ideas.)

*** Facts About Me ***
===============================================================================
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] I'm a third-year
graduate student in computer science. That means I mostly panic about my quals
project.
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] I'm also trying to
write some papers with Prof. Henry_Greenside of Duke_University (and recently
finished a master's_thesis by myself) on steady-state solutions of a particular
nonlinear biharmonic PDE. Because the stability criterion for explicit methods
is so restrictive (a fourth power of the spatial resolution), implicit
timestepping methods such as backwards Euler are necessary. The numerical
analysis issues involve Newton's method for solving the implicit nonlinear
equations, sparse matrix solution methods for solving for the Newton step, and
some interplay between them.
And the pictures_[(picture)] can be really spiffy.
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] I'm working on an
n-body code for astrophysics simulation. This work is in support of a project
on data_structures by Prof. Richard_Anderson
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] I'm working on a
signal processing/computer music project aiming at automatic transcription from
an acoustic signal. Prof. Anna_Karlin is the musician who got me interested in
this project.
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] Like everybody
else, I've got a page of
 applets
. (This first link is just text and small graphics.)
[http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/eric/pix/tinybullet.gif] Like everybody
else, I've got a page of snapshots, mostly family. (I can now prove I've got
all those brothers.)

the weather_in_Seattle.
