***** Research Interests *****
My current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily in the
area of machine learning. They include:
    * Natural Language Acquisition: Learning parsers, lexicons, information
      extraction, and word sense disambiguation from examples.
    * Inductive Logic Programming: Learning Prolog programs from examples.
    * Knowledge-Base and Theory Refinement: Automatically modifying rule bases
      and Bayesian networks to fit empirical data.
    * Search-Control Acquisition: Learning to improve planning efficiency and
      quality.
    * Comparing and combining neural-network and symbolic learning.

***** Personal History *****
I grew up in the 60's and 70's in the small town of O'Fallon_Illinois where
starting in 1975 I attended O'Fallon_Township_Highschool. Starting in the fall
of 1979, I went to the University_of_Illinois in Champaign-Urbana to obtain all
of the degrees listed above. In December 1987, I completed my Ph.D. thesis in
the Explanation-Based_Learning_Group under the direction of Prof._Gerald_Dejong
and then began my position here in The_Department_of_Computer_Sciences at the
The_University_of_Texas_at_Austin.
