9/5/96 - Server is fixed! Give it a try.
Note: This page is only interesting if you follow the directions, download the
viewer and look at the models.
I am currently working with Tony_Derose, David_Salesin, Werner_Stuetzle, Tom
DuChamp, and Jovan_Popovic on the 3D-Scanning_project. I am currently building
a viewer which you can download here (requires SGI graphics workstation).
Our paper is here.
 Once you have the viewer, you can use it to look at our models, once you have
modified Netscape in this way. (It should also work with other browsers if you
modify them in a similar way).
