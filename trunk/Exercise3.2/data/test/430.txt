Paul Beame is an Associate Professor in the Department_of_Computer_Science_&
Engineering at the University_of_Washington.
Paul received his B.Sc. in Mathematics in 1981, an M.Sc. in Computer Science in
1982, and Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1987, all from the University_of
Toronto. He was a Post-doctoral Research Associate at M.I.T. for the 1986-87
academic year and joined the University of Washington in Autumn 1987. In 1988
he received an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award.
Paul's research is concerned primarily with computational complexity and the
theoretical aspects of parallel and distributed computing. His recent research
has concentrated on connections between computational complexity and proof
theory, in particular, on the complexity of proofs in propositional proof
systems.
Paul enjoys squash and softball and other sports where enthusiasm can
compensate for a lack of talent.
