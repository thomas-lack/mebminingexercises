****** Who am I? ******
===============================================================================
I am a student in the 6-year_BS/MEng/MBA_program at Cornell_University. This
joint degree program is offered jointly through the College_of_Engineering and
the Johnson_Graduate_School_of_Management. In May of 1996, I will receive a
Master_of_Engineering in Computer_Science. The following year, 1997, I will
receive a Master_of_Business_Administration.
I am also currently the President of the Cornell Chapter of Acacia_Fraternity.
If you are a brother of the Cornell Chapter or any other chapter of Acacia and
you would like to become a part of our mailing list, then please contact me
through e-mail at tep1@cornell.edu and I will add you as soon as I can. If you
supply me with your chapter and your roll number then I will be able to
complete your request more quickly.

****** Where am I? ******
Well, the best way to reach me is through e-mail at tep1@cornell.edu. I check
my mail year round so I can always be contacted this way. Since I am an MEng
student, I can also be found many times logged on to the CS department's
computers.
===============================================================================
****** Where I worked as a Co-op ******
The Fall semester of my Junior year and the following two semesters, I worked
as a Co-op (intern) with BDM_International,_Inc. through the Engineering
Cooperative Program at Cornell. This program enables Cornell Undergraduate
students in the College of Engineering to supplement their classroom knowledge
with practical experience working for a company in their field of experience.
At BDM, I worked on the development and enhancement of two national level
client/server database systems. The server software is run on Sun Microsystem
computers and the client software is run on PC's running Windows.

This page is still under construction. I hope to add some more content to this
page (possibly including some useful Java applets). Oh, in case you were
wondering, I created the "Ticker Tape" applet at the top. The construction
applet was borrowed (with permission) from Sun's Java Developer's Kit.
