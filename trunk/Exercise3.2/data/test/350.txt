***** Areas of Interest *****
Numerical analysis, parallel supercomputing, scientific computing
***** Summary of Research *****
The introduction of parallel computers has forced a re-evaluation of
traditional numerical methods that were developed for sequential machines. In
some cases, the techniques continue to be useful; in other cases, new methods
may prove to perform better. My research concentrates on the development of
parallel techniques for implementing numerical methods as well as an
environment that allows such methods to be easily implemented on various
parallel processors.
