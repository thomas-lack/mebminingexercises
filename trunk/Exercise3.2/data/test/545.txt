Hi there! My name is Shuichi Koga (if you haven't noticed by now). I've just
started up graduate studies here at the University of Washington. I haven't
quite figured out what I'll be doing yet for my quals (much less my
dissertation!).
I graduated from the University_of_Virginia in May 1995 with a degree in
Mathematics. I was also heavily involved with the asian studies, foreign
relations, and government departments (I was originally slated to also get a
degree in asian studies). I also was heavily involved with the User_Interface
Group and the computer_science_department working on a project called Alice.
Since you're here anyways, why don't you take a look at...
  A picture_of_me at 2:00am (230K). Here's a smaller_one (18K).

  What I do a lot of: hunt and destroy bugs.
