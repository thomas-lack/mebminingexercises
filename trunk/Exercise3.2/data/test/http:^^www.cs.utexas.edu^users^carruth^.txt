***** Introduction *****
I am a Ph.D. candidate at UT-Austin in the Department_of_Computer_Sciences. My
supervising professor is Jayadev_Misra and my dissertation topic is Real-Time
UNITY. I am a member of Professor Misra's PSP_research_group.
I am extending the UNITY theory in order to express finite time bounds on the
usual UNITY operators for progress and safety. I am also interested in
functional programming languages, partial order semantics and automated theorem
proving.
