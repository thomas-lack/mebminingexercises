**** Chaotic People ****
All sorts of people work on the Chaotic Routing project.
**** Research Papers and Technical Reports ****
A repository of all of the research_papers_and_technical_reports of the Chaotic
Routing project is available.
**** Chaos Router Chip ****
The Chaos_Router_Chip is an implementation of the chaos routing algorithm in
hardware. It has been built and tested in 1.2 micron CMOS, and redesigned in a
0.8 micron process for better performance.
**** Simulator ****
The Chaos_Router_Simulator is a powerful simulator which can simulate all sorts
of networks and routing algorithms. It includes a very nice graphical_front
end!
**** Standards for Presentation of Results ****
At PCRCW_'94, we discussed the presentation of simulation results for routing
algorithms. We were able to come up with some guidelines for presentation of
results.
**** Other Research Groups ****
We're building a list of all research_groups that have webs describing research
in routing and/or interconnection networks.
**** Parallel Computer Routing and Communication Workshop (PCRCW) '94 ****
PCRCW '94 was held at the Univeristy of Washington in Seattle in May 1994.
Proceedings are available now.
