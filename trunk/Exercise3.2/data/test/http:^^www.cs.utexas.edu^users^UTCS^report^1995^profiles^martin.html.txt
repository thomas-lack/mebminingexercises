****** Norman M. Martin ******
Professor Emeritus of Computer Sciences; Professor Emeritus of Philosophy
M.A. in Philosophy (1947)
University of Chicago
Ph.D. in Philosophy (1952)
University of California, Los Angeles
***** Areas of Interest *****
Mathematical logic and computer architecture
***** Summary of Research *****
My current activity concentrates on abstract structures as interpretations of
logical theory, centering on closure spaces, which exploits the notion of
deductive closure; on logical operations; and on intensional models of
classical mathematics. My most significant earlier research was on computer
architecture and logical design, especially for missile and space vehicle
applications, tracking algorithms for track-while-scan radars, functional
completeness in many-valued and delay logic and logical metatheory.
