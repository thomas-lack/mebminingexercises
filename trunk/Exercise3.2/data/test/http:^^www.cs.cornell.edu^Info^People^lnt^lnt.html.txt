**** Lloyd N. Trefethen
Professor ****

**** LNT@cs.cornell.edu ****
My appointment at Cornell is in the Computer_Science_Department. I am also
affiliated with the Center_for_Applied_Mathematics, the Department_of
Mathematics, and the Cornell_Theory_Center.
My field is numerical analysis / scientific computing; I have a personal_view
of what this means. Specific interests include numerical linear algebra,
numerical solution of PDE, numerical conformal mapping, approximation theory,
and fluid mechanics. In recent years much of my work has been related to non-
normal matrices and operators, that is, matrices and operators whose
eigenvectors are not orthogonal, and applications.
