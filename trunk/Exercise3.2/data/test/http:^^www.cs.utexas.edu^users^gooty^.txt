***** Intro *****
 Welcome to the Home page of Subramanyam Gooty (as the bold name at the start
suggests). Continue on reading to get to know me ( hopefully u wont be
disappointed ).
***** Old is Gold *****
 Well I was born on Sept 1 1973 (somebody interested) in Hyderabad. This place
is in Andhra_Pradesh (for people interested in geography) a southern state in
India. For the people who are curious to know about my family.
After schooling, I joined Osmania_University, College_of_Technology for my
Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering. Came into contact with people from varying
background and thoughts. Made a lot of friends. We were always proud to call
ourselves THE_BATCH_OF_1990-94.
Then in 1994 came over to USA to University_of_Nebraska-Lincoln. Had a great
gala time there. It was there that I became addicted to American football.
Except for the cold winter every thing else was just great. Studied there for
one year in Computer Science before I transferred over to University of Texas-
Austin.
***** Life's On ... *****
 Now I am presently enrolled in the Masters program in the Computer_Science
Department of University_of_Texas-Austin. Austin is a real cool place to hang
around. I especially like the weather out here.
Here in Austin also I have made a lot of friends (as usual) . Here are some of
the fun loving and acad caring people (I listed this out in alphabetical order.
So no ........)
Abraham
Gokul
Kumar
Mehul
Neeraj
Shantanu
Shailesh
Vipin
***** As I like it ... *****
 One of the things I like the best is to keep on chatting to friends (I know
many of u out there know it !). I also like making new friends , travelling
around. Playing games is another one. I play games like Chess (any questions),
Carrom Board, Racquet Ball, Tennis, Table Tennis , Cricket, Soccer .... and on
and on. I love watching NBA_games.
I like to read some books (not definetly text books). Want to check my
horoscope_for_today. Check out ur compatabile_love_signs. I also like to listen
to old hindi songs. Well there is a lot more to write but I would not like to
bore you and also narrow down my options of some one liking me!!
***** Golden Future *****
 It goes without saying that "Man Controls His Destiny". So what ever success I
have in my life will of course be attributed to my "Hardwork", "Wil power" and
all good things. If some thing bad happens we can always say "Man Proposes and
God Disposes....".
