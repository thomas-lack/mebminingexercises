[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/schwartz/logo.gif]Welcome to the home page of
the Software Systems Generator Research Group!
Software system generators are tools for assembling complex software from
interchangeable, reusable components. We have developed GenVoca, a domain-
independent model of software construction that defines systems as algebraic
equations, where terms are components. GenVoca has been successfully applied to
many domains including database management systems, avionics, and data
structures. Our results have demonstrated GenVoca generators can substantially
improve productivity and application run-time performance.
If this is your first visitand you havequestions on what is the best place to

****** [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/schwartz/7blox.gif]Overview (Getting
Started) ******
Software components that are used by generators to build software systems are
not typical software modules. Components encapsulate a feature of a domain that
many systems of that domain may share. For this to be possible, components must
encapsulate refinements of many different parts (e.g., classes) of a software
system. Some of these refinements require the manipulation of metadata and
reflective computations. Thus, it is likely that our basic approach goes beyond
simple object-orientation to that of large-scale program transformations.
To get a feel for the basic issues           * Scalable_Software_Libraries
involved and the breadth of GenVoca's        * Creating_Reference
applicability, I'd recommend the               Architectures...
following papers for starters (and read      * The_Design_and_Implementation...
them in this order):                         * Composition_Validation_and

Periodically, I release lecture notes for my tutorial on &quot;Software System
Generators, Architectures, and Reuse&quot;. When available, lecture_notes are
distributed as a tar file containing compressed postscript files.
