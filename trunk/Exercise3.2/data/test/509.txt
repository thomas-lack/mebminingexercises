           Gonna get my PhD, I'm a teenage lobotomy. -- The Ramones
I am living on the East Coast, about 3000 miles east of Seattle, and working
for MERL as noted above. I am currently involved with a project concerning
real-time volume rendering of medical data.
In my copious free time as an expatriate graduate student, I am working on
chaotic_routing with faculty advisors Carl_Ebeling and Larry_Snyder. Chaotic
routing is a packet routing algorithm for mesh and torus networks. My
dissertation is on the design and implementation of the Cranium message-passing
interface that is compatible with a network using chaotic routing.
===============================================================================
***** Past projects *****
 I was a teaching assistant for CSE_142 in Summer 1994.
I designed and implemented a chip tester called the MacTester.
I was the maintainer for Carl's netlist graph isomorphism tool called Gemini.
In industry-speak it is known as an LVS (Layout Vs. Schematic) tool. Gemini is
available by FTP; if you are interested, please send e-mail to Larry McMurchie
(larry@cs.washington.edu).

***** Personal information *****
 [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mckenzie/angel-small.gif]_Angel and I
married in 1991.
Here is a picture_of_our_house in Arlington, Massachusetts.
Before heading to the East Coast, we used to live in the fashionable Seattle
neighborhood of Ballard.
Here is Angel's_Creative_Page, which contains some examples of her computer
artwork created using Adobe Photoshop.
I owned this_car for 11 years. Now only the memories remain.
I_won a T-shirt by correctly guessing the answer to Riddle_du_Jour on October
7, 1995.
This is the label that is placed on jars of McKenzie_Country_Farm_Honey
produced by my uncle Bob McKenzie in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
