Hi, friend! Welcome to my homepage. As you know, I am a graduate student in the
Department_of_Computer_Scinces, the_University_of_Texas_at_Austin.
I was born in Beijing, the capital city of China. I got my Bachelor degree in
Peking_University. You will meet a lot of my_friends_and_former_classmates_in
Peking_University. Here you can find more people in the Peking_University
Alumni_Home_Page_(Overseas).
   Now I enjoy living in Austin, Texas.

like, and what I am, as well as find lots of valuable information and fun!
