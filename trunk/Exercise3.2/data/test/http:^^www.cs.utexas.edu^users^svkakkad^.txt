***** Research Information *****
I am a member of the OOPS_Research_Group in the Department_of_Computer_Sciences
at The_University_of_Texas_at_Austin.
As part of my Ph.D. research, I have implemented a persistent storage system,
called Texas, for C++. It provides easy persistence, while using a novel
technique called "pointer swizzling at page fault time" to efficiently support
large addresses on standard hardware.
For more information, please see the list_of_my_publications (along with brief
descriptions).
I plan to graduate with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 1996. My resume is
available in Postscript.
I am currently working at Motorola at Somerset Design Center, while finishing
up my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
