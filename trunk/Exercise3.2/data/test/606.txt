      order to download the paper
      Affine systems: the analysis of the analysis operator
      of Zuowei Shen and me, choose between the following versions:
      if you are using Unix, click HERE, to get a compressed version.
      Otherwise, download the uncompressed version from HERE.
      If none works, our ftp server may be down. Try then to get a copy
      directly from my account HERE.

      anonymous ftp site. Carl de Boor and I maintain an ftp site at
      ftp.cs.wisc.edu. The site contains postscript and compressed postscript
      files of various articles of the approximation theory group at UW. Also
      found there are technical files concerning TeX, vi and more, that should
      be useful to the general public. I recommend that you click the read.me
      file, which provides a list of available files, click there those that
      you wish to view (on-line), view them on-line, and download those you
      wish to.
