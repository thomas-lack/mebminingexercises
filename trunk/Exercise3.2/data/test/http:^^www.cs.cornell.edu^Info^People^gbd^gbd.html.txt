 [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/gbd/Images/red.gif] Undergraduate

I completed my undergraduate in June '96 at Karnataka_Regional_Engineering
College, Surathkal, India . I majored in Computer Science. My major interest
was in Multimedia. Other courses related to Computer Science were Operating
Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Compiler Construction, Data Communications
and Computer Graphics.

[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/gbd/Images/red.gif] Graduate

I am presently at Cornell_University pursuing a Master_of_Engineeringdegree in
Computer Science. I am specialising in Multimedia and after graduation, I want
to be involved in projects dealing with multimedia and web server programming.

                                   Personal

Well! Let`s see. Where do I start? OK! Here goes ...
Once upon a time, long, long ago (actually on November 1, 1973), in a land they
call Bharat (India for the outside world) at precise 12:00pm was born a cute,
chubby little baby weighing approximately four pounds. He took on the name
Deepak (meaning light) and went on (actually he's still in the process) to
change the world. Incidentally, (or probably out of divine interference)
Aishwarya Rai (Miss World 1994) was born on the same day. My! Isn't she lucky
to be born on the same day as me?
Leaving out the miniscule details of my earlier life, let's dive straight into
high school. Well, I'm lucky to have been to National Public School, Bangalore
for a greater part of my schooling. Now, that's the place for someone to be!!
And college? Nothings better than KREC. Thats where I majored in Computer
Science. I wonder how long it will be before I get another four year holiday.
To have been a part of the all-conquering Class_of_'96 was a joy never to be
matched.
And here I am, at Cornell_University pursuing a masters degree in Computer
Science. Well, I just hope it gets me somewhere.
And finally, heres a link to my friends :
