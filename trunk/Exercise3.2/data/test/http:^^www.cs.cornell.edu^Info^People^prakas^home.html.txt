I am a Ph.D student in the department of Computer_Science at Cornell
University. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at IIT
Madras. At Cornell, I work in the Bernoulli_group with Prof_Keshav_Pingali.
Other members of my group are Nawaaz Ahmed, Vladimir_Kotlyar, Vijay_Menon and
Paul_Stodghill. I am also affiliated with the Advanced_Computing_Research
Institute and the Cornell_Theory_Center.

*****
My work centers on the interplay between applications, compilers and runtime
systems for traditional and multiprocessor architectures. The applications are
derived from scientific computing, image processing and multimedia. My co-op
with IBM's VLIW_group has interested me in computer architecture as well.

*****
    * I've given a series of talks on dense compiler technology.
          o The first talk at HP_Chelmsford, in Feb '95
 was about the necessity to deal with imperfectly nested loop transformations
to be able to handle non trivial code.
I presented a framework for performing imperfectly nested loop transformations
at the Loop Parallelization seminar in Schloss Dagstuhl in April '96.
In summer '95, I presented a talk at IBM_Watson regarding the use of loop
transformations in a VLIW compiler.
In October '96, I presented a talk at HP_Labs_(Palo_Alto) regarding Data-
centric Multi-level Blocking.

I (aka GNU Czar) install, maintain and support packages available under the GNU
General Public License on the CS department machines. Check out the CS_GNU_home
and find handy tips to be able to do all this on your own! You can also find
extensive info on all the packages I support.
