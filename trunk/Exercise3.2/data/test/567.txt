I am a postdoc in the Department_of_Computer_Science_&_Engineering at the
University_of_Washington (in Seattle, WA). I am a member of the SPIN_project.
I received my PhD from the Department_of_Electrical_Engineering_and_Computer
Science in the School_of_Engineering at MIT, where I worked in the Laboratory
for_Computer_Science. My advisors were Frans_Kaashoek and Bill_Weihl.
Most of my research has been in compilation and parallel systems. My research
interests lie in the interactions among compilers, programming languages,
runtime and operating systems, and architectures.
