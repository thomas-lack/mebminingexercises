***** [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif] Grading Policy *****
Your final grade is based on seven programming assignments each worth 5% (not
including Program #0) and three exams. Your highest two exam scores will each
contribute 25% to your final grade; your lowest exam score will contribute 15%.
You must complete and hand in all the assignments to be eligible to receive a
passing grade for the course. Final grades for all CS 302 sections are graded
on a curve with a mean in the range of 2.8 - 3.0, where A = 4.0; the curve is
computed after the final exam is completed.
  Exam 1
      Thur February 29, 7:15 - 9:15 pm
  Exam 2
      Wed April 10, 7:15 - 9:15 pm, Rm. 1207 Computer Science
  Final
      Mon May 13, 7:55 - 9:45 am

***** [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif] Syllabus (tentative)
*****
The following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered
each week during the semester. You will only get the most out of this class if
you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class. This way you
will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of,
instead of waiting until you're in the lab trying to work on an assignment to
discover you didn't really understand something.
   1. Weeks_1-6 (Mid-Term Exam #1)
   2. Weeks_7-11 (Mid-Term Exam #2)
   3. Weeks_12-15 (Final Exam)

Fortran with Engineering Applications, 5th. edition, by E. Koffman and F.
Friedman, 1993.
**** Lecture Notes: ****
Copies of the lecture notes will be available on-line at the end of each week
of class. IMPORTANT - the on-line lecture notes are not a substitute for coming
to class and only cover what I show on the overhead projector. They do not
include any examples or additional notes that I put on the board. You are
responsible for all the material covered in class.

***** [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif] Exams and
Programming Assignments *****
There are three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam. Exams constitute
65% of your final grade so it is very important to do well on them to ensure a
good grade, regardless of your performance on the assignments. All exams are
approximately two hours long (though you may stay a bit longer if you need
extra time) and are closed-book. You only need to bring a pen or pencil to
exams - calculators are not necessary or even useful.
**** Exam Solutions: ****
    * Mid-Term_Exam_#1
    * Mid-Term_Exam_#2
There are seven programming assignments (not including Program #0) each
contributing 5% to your final grade. All the assignments must be completed and
handed in to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course. You must
attempt to complete every programming assignment. If you hand in a program that
does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded
and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk failing the course.

**** How to Get Help with Your Assignments: ****
  Consultants:
      The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems. They
      wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.
      Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and
      program syntax, as well as how to login, use the printers, send E-mail,
      run Netscape, etc.
          * Click here for more information about the consultants.
  Instructor:
      General questions about an assignment or questions that may require a
      long explanation are best answered by myself. Please see me during office
      hours or send me E-mail. I am not normally in my office except during
      office hours because I do my dissertation research from home via a modem.
      Therefore, if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an
      appointment first. You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I
      regularly login and read my E-mail from home.

***** [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif] Problem Solving
Exercises *****
One of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem
solving. Good problem solving skills distinguish a "good" computer programmer
from a "bad" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a
particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the
problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any
language.
To help you learn problem solving skills and techniques I will assign weekly
problem solving exercises. These will be small but non-trivial problems which I
will give out each Monday. You should look at the problem and think about it
during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the
problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program. This is primarily an
exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN
code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm
should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as
FORTRAN. Each Friday we will go over the solution in class.

***** [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif] Computer Lab *****
You will be using the Vectra_lab in Rm. 1350 Computer Science & Statistics
containing Hewlett-Packard Vectra's running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft
FORTRAN. This lab is open from 7:00 am to 1:00 am seven days a week except
certain holidays. The printer room is located across the hall in Rm. 1359.
You may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs, however
you will probably have to purchase your own copy of Microsoft FORTRAN or Lahey
Personal FORTRAN (see the inside cover of the textbook). You may also work in
any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN
compilers (please see me first before using the CAE_lab).
The software you will be using in the lab includes:
    * Microsoft_Windows and MS-DOS
    * www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/Software/Email/Email.html">E-mail
Netscape
