576 and contains information about the class. Keep in mind that this document
is not static, and that new information (especially class messages) will be

***** Assignments *****
    * The first assignment is to read Chapter 1 of the course notes and do
      exercise 5.
      =========================================================================
    * The second assignment is due Wednesday, April 5. Read Chapter 2 of the
      course notes and do exercises 1-7. Next, determine the most convenient
      way to run KHOROS and CANTATA for you. In CSE it runs on Suns such as
      Lillith. Edit your local workstation's .login file to contain xhost
      +lillith Then add to you .cshrc file on the Suns the following:
          o setenv KHOROS_HOME /usr/local/khoros
          o setenv MANPATH /usr/local/khoros/man
          o set path=($KHOROS_HOME/bin $path)
    * After an rlogin onto Lillith with your rhost assignments and DISPLAY
      environment variable set up appropriately, type cantata at the Unix
      prompt. In EE, the machine "george" has KHOROS and CANTATA installed on
      it. Also go to our course home page on the WWW http://
      www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/576/index.html and follow the
      links to the KHOROS/CANTATA tutorial. Go to its course outline, to
      "experiments" and do at least the first two topics ("Image information"
      and "Spatial Resolution"). The ideal way to take the tutorial is to read
      the web pages and experiment with KHOROS in another X window. There is
      nothing to turn in for this part of the assignment.
      =========================================================================
    * The third assignment is to read the article by Lin, Huertas, and Nevatia
      on pp.62-69 of the CVPR'94 proceedings, and also to look at the article
      by Wolff on pp.369-376.
      =========================================================================
    * The fourth assignment is due Monday, April 17. In this assignment, we
      make a comparison of three image-processing software environments:
      KHOROS, MSVC/C++ & "Image", and MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. The
      objects of the assignment are (1) to gain some experience with each
      environment, (2) to begin to get a feel for the strengths and weaknesses
      of each of these environments, and (3) to explore the use of convolution
      in noise suppression and edge detection. In each environment: (a) select
      a monochrome test image. (b) apply the Sobel operation to the test image.
      (c) apply a moving average filter to the test image. (d) apply a 3 by 3
      laplacian to the test image. (e) simulate gaussian smoothing with larger
      standard-deviation gaussians by iteratively applying the moving average
      filter. (f) apply the 3 by 3 laplacian to each gaussian-smoothed image.
      (g) describe the results obtained in terms of changes in appearance to
      objects and contours in the test image. (h) describe the following
      aspects of the implementation: what menu selections, direct
      manipulations, or programming you had to do to perform the experiments;
      how fast the operations ran; and level of learning effort required on
      your part.
***** Announcements *****
The final examination will be on Monday, June 5 from 2:30 to 4:20PM in our
regular class meeting room. The exam will cover a combination of pre-midterm
and post-midterm material. Here is a list of topics to study. Reminder: the
class approved Sunday, June 4 from 1:30-2:30 as the time for the final-exam
review meeting. The plan is to meet in Sieg 422.
===============================================================================
Outlines for selected class periods are available here: Friday,_28_April.
Monday,_1_May. Wednesday,_3_May. Monday,_8_May. Friday,_12_May. Monday,_15_May.
Wednesday,_17_May. Friday,_19_May. Monday,_22_May. Wednesday,_24_May. Copies of
the overhead transparencies for the May 22 and 24 lectures on neural nets are
available at the Engineering Library Copy Center (2nd floor) as CSE/EE 576
packet number 2 ("Trainable Classifiers"). Friday,_26_May. Students in 576 are
permitted to get a temporary copy of MATLAB for their own use in the course.
This will require that you fill out a form and sign a contract. Let me know if
you are interested.
===============================================================================
Term_projects are an important part of the course. These are to be started
during the week of April 24.
===============================================================================
Here are some corrections_to_the_course_notes.
===============================================================================
On Friday, April 7, we were introduced to the Pentium laboratory, including the
MSVC/C++ software development environment. Here is Evan_McLain's_document
explaining how to add a new transform to the Image application.
===============================================================================
Here is Current_status_of_the_KHOROS_installation_on_the_Suns. It contains the
most recent information about getting started with Khoros and the accompanying
DIP course. Please read this.
===============================================================================
No class on Friday, March 31 or Monday, April 3.
===============================================================================
Most students already have a computer account that can access KHOROS and
CANTATA. If you do not, contact Renee Reed on Thursday or Friday to make an
arrangement to pick up your account login name and password so that you can use
it over the weekend and early next week. Renee's hours are limited, so plan
ahead. Her email address is reed@cs, and she is in part of Sieg 127 (in a back
office). Sieg 127 is kept locked, so you will either need to knock or have a
prior arrangement to meet her. Many of the account application cards were not
signed. We will have to take care of that next week.
