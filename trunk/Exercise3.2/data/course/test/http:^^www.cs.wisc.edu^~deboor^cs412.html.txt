    * changes on 06nov: useful email concerning problem_3 (05nov) UPDATED
      06nov. Since there was a question about the computational complexity of
      numerical analysis algorithms, I have posted a preprint, by one of the
      foremost mathematicians of today, on that subject, for those interested
      in this tricky topic.

    * The text is brand new: Introduction to Scientific Computing, by C. Van
      Loan (Computer Science Department, Cornell University), Prentice-Hall,
      hence there is a growing list_of_errata_for_the_text; also the text may
      be supplemented here and there by additional_material (12sep, 19sep,
      24sep, 26sep, 01oct, 08oct, 10oct, 15oct,  17oct, 29oct). All the m-files
      mentioned in the book are available, organized by chapter. Be aware,
      though, that, on the ftp_site mentioned in the book as well as here, all
      their names begin with a capital letter while, sometimes, their name in
      the book begins with lower case letter.

      24sep, 26sep, 01oct, 03oct, 08oct, 10oct, 15oct, 29oct.
    * Present plans are to have all computing assignments in MATLAB (rather
      than Fortran or C).
    * Kermit Sigmon's MATLAB Primer, 3rd Edition, is available at DoIT, for
      $1.95; look for Handout #2 for CS 525 or under CS 412.
    * one student's reaction to the student_edition_of_MATLAB.
