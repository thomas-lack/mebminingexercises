Welcome to the home page for CS564-2. This page is (obviously) under
construction; as the semester progresses we will be adding information that you
need to know to this page.
The most important thing to know now is that the class meeting room has been
changed. Currently we are meeting in 150 Russell Labs for the TR lectures; the
optional discussion on Friday has not been moved so it is still in 103
Psychology.

This lecture of 564 will be taught in close cooperation with Lecture 1; in
fact, the assignments (but probably not the exams) will be the same for both.
For more information about CS564 in general, and the Minibase assignments in
particular, please see the CS564_Lecture_1_Homepage.
