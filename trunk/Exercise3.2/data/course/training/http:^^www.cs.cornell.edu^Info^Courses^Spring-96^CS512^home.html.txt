***** Description: *****
Modern programming languages, such as SML, Java, Haskell, and Dylan, provide
high-level features such as:
    * objects and closures,
    * polymorphism, abstract data types, and classes,
    * garbage collection,
    * exceptions and continuations,
    * threads and synchronization constructs.
This class will survey modern techniques for efficient implementation of these
features. Our focus will be on the implementation of modern functional
languages, but we will make connections to other kinds of languages, notably
object-oriented.
