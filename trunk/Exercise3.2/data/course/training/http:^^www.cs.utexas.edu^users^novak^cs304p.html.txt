****** CS 304P: Foundations of Computer Science ******
===============================================================================
CS 304P is an introduction to Computer Science and programming.
This section of CS 304P is intended for CS majors who have had at least a
semester of programming in high school; the course number will be changed to CS
306 next year. If you have never taken a programming course before, you should
take Porter's section of CS 304P instead. A strong math background, at least
through precalculus, is required.
We will use the programming language Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. The Scheme
implementation we will use is called Gambit and runs on Macintosh computers.
This course will move faster than the previous CS 304P courses and will
emphasize CS concepts more than programming language syntax. We will do a lot
of programming and work hard, while hopefully learning a lot and having fun.
