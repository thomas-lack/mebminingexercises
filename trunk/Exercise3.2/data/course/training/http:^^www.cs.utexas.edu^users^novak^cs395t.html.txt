****** CS 395T: Automatic Programming ******
===============================================================================
Automatic Programming is the generation of executable programs from
specifications that are higher-level than ordinary programming languages.
The course will consist of lectures for the first two-thirds of the semester.
Homework problems and programming assignments will be given to illustrate the
lecture material. The programs will not be long, but will require learning to
use several kinds of programming systems. The latter part of the semester will
cover readings in the research literature. Students will be expected to present
one or two papers to the class.
