About file formats: Most of the course materials above are provided in three
formats:
   HTML:
       HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the document format handled by WWW
       browsers, in fact you are currently looking viewing an HTML document.
       Many of the handouts we've provided were originally LaTeX documents that
       have been converted to HTML using LaTeX2HTML, which is why they can be a
       bit strange.
   LaTeX:
       Plain ASCII text including formating commands. Simple things (e.g.
       assignments) are generally quite legible in this format. For figures and
       complex math stuff, these are hard-to-impossible to read.
   PostScript:
       The Ghostscript_Home_Page has free viewers (Mac, Windows, OS/2, Linux,
       ...)
